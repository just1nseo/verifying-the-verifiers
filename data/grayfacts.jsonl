"reference_documents": ["Pennsylvania Route 946 (PA 946) is a rural [[Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]] state highway that runs approximately 18.2 miles (29.3 km) from [[Pennsylvania_Route_248|PA 248]] in [[Berlinsville,_Pennsylvania|Berlinsville]] east to [[Pennsylvania_Route_191|PA 191]] in [[Newburg,_Northampton_County,_Pennsylvania|Newburg]] in [[Northampton_County,_Pennsylvania|Northampton County]] in the [[Lehigh_Valley|Lehigh Valley]] region of the state.\nThe route heads east from PA 248 a short distance to the south of [[Blue_Mountain_(Pennsylvania)|Blue Mountain]], passing through [[Danielsville,_Pennsylvania|Danielsville]] and intersecting the northern terminus of [[Pennsylvania_Route_987|PA 987]] in [[Klecknersville,_Pennsylvania|Klecknersville]].\nAfter intersecting [[Pennsylvania_Route_512|PA 512]] in [[Moorestown,_Pennsylvania|Moorestown]], PA 946 turns southeast and intersects PA 248 again before reaching its terminus at PA 191.\nPA 946 was first designated in 1928 onto an unpaved road running from a point between Danielsville and Youngsville and PA 512 in Moorestown while part of PA 512 ran along the alignment east of Moorestown.\nIn the 1930s, PA 946 was extended to its current alignment, replacing that section of PA 512, and was paved.\nRoute description\nPA 946 begins at an intersection with [[Pennsylvania_Route_248|PA 248]] in the community of [[Berlinsville,_Pennsylvania|Berlinsville]] in [[Lehigh_Township,_Northampton_County,_Pennsylvania|Lehigh Township]] in [[Northampton_County,_Pennsylvania|Northampton County]], which is in the [[Lehigh_Valley|Lehigh Valley]], heading northeast on two-lane undivided Mountain View Drive.\nWest of PA 248, Mountain View Drive continues towards the borough of [[Walnutport,_Pennsylvania|Walnutport]].\nFrom the western terminus, the route passes through a mix of farms, woods, and residences.\nThe road curves east and reaches the residential community of [[Danielsville,_Pennsylvania|Danielsville]], where it intersects Blue Mountain Drive a short distance south of [[Blue_Mountain_(Pennsylvania)|Blue Mountain]].\nPast this community, PA 946 heads southeast through a mix of rural areas and residences, curving east and passing through the community of Rockville.\nThe route crosses into [[Moore_Township,_Pennsylvania|Moore Township]] and runs through a mix of farmland and woodland, passing through the community of Youngsville and crossing the [[Hokendauqua_Creek|Hokendauqua Creek]].\nThe road curves southeast into residential areas, passing through [[Klecknersville,_Pennsylvania|Klecknersville]] before coming to the northern terminus of [[Pennsylvania_Route_987|PA 987]] in Cross Roads.\nAt this point, PA 987 continues southeast and PA 946 turns northeast onto Community Drive, passing more homes before curving east into a mix of farm fields and woods with a few residences.\nThe route curves southeast and reaches the community of [[Moorestown,_Pennsylvania|Moorestown]], where it crosses [[Pennsylvania_Route_512|PA 512]].\nPast this intersection, the road becomes Nazareth Drive and curves south, passing residential neighborhoods.\nPA 946 heads southeast into a mix of farms, woods, and homes, where it crosses into [[Bushkill_Township,_Pennsylvania|Bushkill Township]] and becomes Daniels Road.\nThe route soon enters [[Upper_Nazareth_Township,_Pennsylvania|Upper Nazareth Township]] and runs south through a mix of farm fields and residential subdivisions before it intersects PA 248 in Christian Springs.\nAfter this intersection, the road passes through a mix of farms and trees to the west of a quarry and crosses [[Norfolk_Southern|Norfolk Southern]]'s Cement Secondary.\nThe route runs through more rural areas and passes through the community of Georgetown before it crosses into [[Lower_Nazareth_Township,_Pennsylvania|Lower Nazareth Township]].\nHere, PA 946 passes through a mix of agricultural areas and residential subdivisions before it reaches its eastern terminus at an intersection with [[Pennsylvania_Route_191|PA 191]] in the community of [[Newburg,_Northampton_County,_Pennsylvania|Newburg]].\nHistory\nThe present-day routing of PA 946 was not legislated as a route when Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911.\nIn 1928, PA 946 was designated along an unpaved road running from a point between Danielsville and Youngsville, where a paved local road continued west towards Walnutport, east to PA 512 in Moorestown.\nThe portion of road between Moorestown and [[Pennsylvania_Route_12_(1930s)|PA 12]] (now PA 191) in Hecktown was designated as the southern portion of PA 512, which was unpaved and was under construction between PA 12 and [[Pennsylvania_Route_45|PA 45]] (now PA 248).\nIn the 1930s, PA 946 was extended to its current alignment between PA 45 (now PA 248) near Walnutport and PA 12 (now PA 191) in Hecktown, by which time the entire road was paved.\nThe route replaced PA 512, which was rerouted to head south to [[Bethlehem,_Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]], between Moorestown and Hecktown.\nPA 946 has remained on the same alignment since.\nMajor intersections\nThe entire route is in [[Northampton_County,_Pennsylvania|Northampton County]].\n[H] Location | [H] mi | [H] km | [H] Destinations | [H]

It is found in the Mapuche language of South America, where it is actually [[Interdental_consonant|interdental]].\nA true dental generally occurs [[Allophone|allophonically]] before /θ/ in languages which have it, as in English tenth.\nSimilarly, a denti-alveolar allophone will occur in languages which have denti-alveolar stops, as in Spanish cinta.\nSome languages contrast laminal denti-alveolar and apical alveolar nasals.\nFor example, in the [[Malayalam|Malayalam]] pronunciation of Nārāyanan, the first n is dental, the second is retroflex, and the third alveolar.\nA postalveolar nasal occurs in a number of Australian Aboriginal languages, including [[Djeebbana_language|Djeebbana]] and [[Jingulu_language|Jingulu]].\nFeatures\nFeatures of the voiced alveolar nasal:\n- Its manner of articulation is [[Occlusive|occlusive]], which means it is produced by obstructing airflow in the vocal tract. Because the consonant is also nasal, the blocked airflow is redirected through the nose.\n- There are four specific variants of [n]:\n[SUB] - [[Dental_consonant|Dental]], which means it is articulated with either the tip or the blade of the tongue at the upper [[Teeth|teeth]], termed respectively [[Apical_consonant|apical]] and laminal.\n[SUB] - [[Denti-alveolar_consonant|Denti-alveolar]], which means it is articulated with the blade of the tongue at the alveolar ridge, and the tip of the tongue behind upper teeth.\n[SUB] - Alveolar, which means it is articulated with either the tip or the blade of the tongue at the alveolar ridge, termed respectively apical and laminal.\n[SUB] - Postalveolar, which means it is articulated with either the tip or the blade of the tongue behind the alveolar ridge, termed respectively apical and laminal.\n- Its [[Phonation|phonation]] is voiced, which means the vocal cords vibrate during the articulation.\n- It is a nasal consonant, which means air is allowed to escape through the nose, either exclusively (nasal stops) or in addition to through the mouth.\n- It is a [[Central_consonant|central consonant]], which means it is produced by directing the airstream along the center of the tongue, rather than to the sides.\n- The airstream mechanism is [[Egressive_sound|pulmonic]], which means it is articulated by pushing air solely with the [[Lung|lungs]] and [[Thoracic_diaphragm|diaphragm]], as in most sounds.\nOccurrence\nDental or denti-alveolar\n[H] Language | [H] Language | [H] Word | [H] [[International_Phonetic_Alphabet|IPA]] | [H] Meaning | [H] Notes\n[[Belarusian_language|Belarusian]] | [[Belarusian_language|Belarusian]] | [[Belarusian_alphabet|новы]]/novy | [ˈn̪ovɨ] | 'new' | Laminal denti-alveolar.

race itself was dramatic.\nClark led away from pole with Hill close behind.\nWith 16 laps to go, the BRM driver had begun experiencing brake issues and was 35 seconds adrift of the leading Lotus.\nThen the Scot started to lose oil pressure, which was getting worse every lap.\nClark - thinking fast - chose to nurse his car to the finish by killing the engine through the fast corners.\nThis meant that he lost at least 2 seconds per lap, which allowed Hill to close up rapidly.\nAt the chequered flag, Clark was still running, but his lead had shrunk to a mere 3

{"topic": "coverbench", "statement": "The sum of Income taxes in 2008 and Municipal investments for LoanCommitments is 1788.0 million.", "reference_documents": ["Citigroup’s repurchases are primarily from Government Sponsored Entities.\n\nThe specific representations and warranties made by the Company depend on the nature of the transaction and the requirements of the buyer.\n\nMarket conditions and credit-ratings agency requirements may also affect representations and warranties and the other provisions the Company may agree to in loan sales.\n\nIn the event of a breach of the representations and warranties, the Company may be required to either repurchase the mortgage loans (generally at unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest) with the identified defects or indemnify (“make-whole”) the investor or insurer.\n\nThe Company has recorded a repurchase reserve that is included in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nIn the case of a repurchase, the Company will bear any subsequent credit loss on the mortgage loans.\n\nThe Company’s representations and warranties are generally not subject to stated limits in amount or time of coverage.\n\nHowever, contractual liability arises only when the representations and warranties are breached and generally only when a loss results from the breach.\n\nIn the case of a repurchase, the loan is typically considered a credit\u0002impaired loan and accounted for under SOP 03-3, “Accounting for Certain Loans and Debt Securities, Acquired in a Transfer” (now incorporated into ASC 310-30, Receivables—Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality).\n\nThese repurchases have not had a material impact on nonperforming loan statistics, because credit-impaired purchased SOP 03-3 loans are not included in nonaccrual loans.\n\nThe Company estimates its exposure to losses from its obligation to repurchase previously sold loans based on the probability of repurchase or make-whole and an estimated loss given repurchase or make-whole.\n\nThis estimate is calculated separately by sales vintage (i. e. , the year the loans were sold) based on a combination of historical trends and forecasted repurchases and losses considering the: (1) trends in requests by investors for loan documentation packages to be reviewed; (2) trends in recent repurchases and make-wholes; (3) historical percentage of claims made as a percentage of loan documentation package requests; (4) success rate in appealing claims; (5) inventory of unresolved claims; and (6) estimated loss given repurchase or make-whole, including the loss of principal, accrued interest, and foreclosure costs.\n\nThe Company does not change its estimation methodology by counterparty, but the historical experience and trends are considered when evaluating the overall reserve.\n\nThe request for loan documentation packages is an early indicator of a potential claim.\n\nDuring 2009, loan documentation package requests and the level of outstanding claims increased.\n\nIn addition, our loss severity estimates increased during 2009 due to the impact of macroeconomic factors and recent experience.\n\nThese factors contributed to a $493 million change in estimate for this reserve in 2009.\n\nAs indicated above, the repurchase reserve is calculated by sales vintage.\n\nThe majority of the repurchases in 2009 were from the 2006 and 2007 sales vintages, which also represent the vintages with the largest loss\u0002given-repurchase.\n\nAn insignificant percentage of 2009 repurchases were from vintages prior to 2006, and this is expected to decrease, because those vintages are later in the credit cycle.\n\nAlthough early in the credit cycle, the Company has experienced improved repurchase and loss-given-repurchase statistics from the 2008 and 2009 vintages.\n\nIn the case of a repurchase of a credit-impaired SOP 03-3 loan (now incorporated into ASC 310-30), the difference between the loan’s fair value and unpaid principal balance at the time of the repurchase is recorded as a utilization of the repurchase reserve.\n\nPayments to make the investor whole are also treated as utilizations and charged directly against the reserve.\n\nThe provision for estimated probable losses arising from loan sales is recorded as an adjustment to the gain on sale, which is included in Other revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nA liability for representations and warranties is estimated when the Company sells loans and is updated quarterly.\n\nAny subsequent adjustment to the provision is recorded in Other revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nThe activity in the repurchase reserve for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 is as follows:\n\n## Table 0 ##\n| 0                              | 1    | 2    |\n|:-------------------------------|:-----|:-----|\n| In millions of dollars         | 2009 | 2008 |\n| Balance, beginning of

year       | $482 | $75  |\n\nGoodwill Goodwill represents an acquired company’s acquisition cost over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired.\n\nGoodwill is subject to annual impairment tests, whereby Goodwill is allocated to the Company’s reporting units and an impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.\n\nFurthermore, on any business dispositions, Goodwill is allocated to the business disposed of based on the ratio of the fair value of the business disposed of to the fair value of the reporting unit.\n\nIntangible Assets Intangible assets—including core deposit intangibles, present value of future profits, purchased credit card relationships, other customer relationships, and other intangible assets, but excluding MSRs—are amortized over their estimated useful lives.\n\nIntangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives, primarily certain asset management contracts and trade names, are not amortized and are subject to annual impairment tests.\n\nAn impairment exists if the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value.\n\nFor other Intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the Intangible asset.\n\nOther Assets and Other Liabilities Other assets include, among other items, loans held-for-sale, deferred tax assets, equity-method investments, interest and fees receivable, premises and equipment, end-user derivatives in a net receivable position, repossessed assets, and other receivables.\n\nThis table does not include: ?\n\ncertain venture capital investments made by some of the Company’s private equity subsidiaries, as the Company accounts for these investments in accordance with the Investment Company Audit Guide; ?\n\ncertain limited partnerships where the Company is the general partner and the limited partners have the right to replace the general partner or liquidate the funds; ?\n\ncertain investment funds for which the Company provides investment management services and personal estate trusts for which the Company provides administrative, trustee and/or investment management services; ?\n\nVIEs structured by third parties where the Company holds securities in inventory.\n\nThese investments are made on arm’s-length terms; and ?\n\ntransferred assets to a VIE where the transfer did not qualify as a sale and where the Company did not have any other involvement that is deemed to be a variable interest with the VIE.\n\nThese transfers are accounted for as secured borrowings by the Company.\n\nThe asset balances for consolidated VIEs represent the carrying amounts of the assets consolidated by the Company.\n\nThe carrying amount may represent the amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets depending on the legal form of the asset (e. g. , security or loan) and the Company’s standard accounting policies for the asset type and line of business.\n\nhe asset balances for unconsolidated VIEs where the Company has significant involvement represent the most current information available to the Company.\n\nIn most cases, the asset balances represent an amortized cost basis without regard to impairments in fair value, unless fair value information is readily available to the Company.\n\nFor VIEs that obtain asset exposures synthetically through derivative instruments (for example, synthetic CDOs), the table includes the full original notional amount of the derivative as an asset.\n\nThe maximum funded exposure represents the balance sheet carrying amount of the Company’s investment in the VIE.\n\nIt reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the VIE plus any accrued interest and is adjusted for any impairments in value recognized in earnings and any cash principal payments received.\n\nThe maximum exposure of unfunded positions represents the remaining undrawn committed amount, including liquidity and credit facilities provided by the Company, or the notional amount of a derivative instrument considered to be a variable interest, adjusted for any declines in fair value recognized in earnings.\n\nIn certain transactions, the Company has entered into derivative instruments or other arrangements that are not considered variable interests in the VIE (e. g. , interest rate swaps, cross\u0002currency swaps, or where the Company is the purchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or total return swap where the Company pays the total return on certain assets to the SPE).\n\nReceivables under such arrangements are not included in the maximum exposure amounts.\n\nFunding Commitments for Significant Unconsolidated VIEs— Liquidity Facilities and Loan Commitments The following table presents the notional amount of liquidity facilities and loan commitments that are classified as funding commitments

management.\n\nNet income increased 12%, leading to a record net income, with growth across all regions reflecting benefits of continued re-engineering and expense management efforts.2008 vs.  2007 Revenues, net of interest expense grew 23% driven by new business and implementations, growth in customer liability balances, increased transaction volumes and the impact of acquisitions.\n\nAverage

Transaction Services business performance will continue to be impacted in 2010 by levels of interest rates, economic activity, volatility in global capital markets, foreign exchange and market valuations globally.\n\nLevels of client activity and client cash and security flows are key factors dependent on macroeconomic conditions.\n\nTransaction Services intends to continue to invest in technology to support its global network, as well as investments to build out its investor services suite of products aimed at large, under\u0002penetrated markets for middle and back office outsourcing among a range of investors.\n\nThese and similar investments could lead to increasing operating expenses.\n\nBROKERAGE AND ASSET MANAGEMENT Brokerage and Asset Management (BAM), which constituted approximately 6% of Citi Holdings by assets as of December 31, 2009, consists of Citi’s global retail brokerage and asset management businesses.\n\nThis segment was substantially affected and reduced in size in 2009 due to the divestitures of Smith Barney (to the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture (MSSB JV)) and Nikko Cordial Securities.\n\nAt December 31, 2009, BAM had approximately $35 billion of assets, which included $26 billion of assets from the 49% interest in the MSSB JV ($13 billion investment and $13 billion in loans associated with the clients of the MSSB JV) and $9 billion of assets from a diverse set of asset management and insurance businesses of which approximately half will be transferred into the LATAM RCB during the first quarter of 2010, as discussed under “Citi Holdings” above.\n\nMorgan Stanley has options to purchase Citi’s remaining stake in the MSSB JV over three years starting in 2012.\n\nThe 2009 results include an $11.1 billion

non-cash stock-based compensation expense totaling $164 million, $189 million and $167 million, which is included as a component of other unallocated, net on our Statements of Earnings.\n\nThe net impact to earnings for the respective years was $107 million, $122 million and $108 million.\n\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $91 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.6 years.\n\nWe received cash from the exercise of stock options totaling $308 million, $827 million and $440 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012.\n\nIn addition, our income tax liabilities for 2014, 2013 and 2012 were reduced by $215 million, $158 million, $96 million due to recognized tax benefits on stock-based compensation arrangements.\n\nStock-Based Compensation Plans Under plans approved by our stockholders, we are authorized to grant key employees stock-based incentive awards, including options to purchase common stock, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance stock units (PSUs) or other stock units.\n\nThe exercise price of options to purchase common stock may not be less than the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant.\n\nNo award of stock options may become fully vested prior to the third anniversary of the grant and no portion of a stock option grant may become vested in less than one year.\n\nThe minimum vesting period for restricted stock or stock units payable in stock is three years.\n\nAward agreements may provide for shorter or pro-rated vesting periods or vesting following termination of employment in the case of death, disability, divestiture, retirement, change of control or layoff.\n\nThe maximum term of a stock option or any other award is 10 years.\n\nAt December 31, 2014, inclusive of the shares reserved for outstanding stock options, RSUs and PSUs, we had 19 million shares reserved for issuance under the plans.\n\nAt December 31, 2014, 7.8 million of the shares reserved for issuance remained available for grant under our stock-based compensation plans.\n\nWe issue new shares upon the exercise of stock options or when restrictions on RSUs and PSUs have been satisfied.\n\nRSUs The following table summarizes activity related to nonvested RSUs during 2014:\n\n## Table 0 ##\n[{\"1\":\"Number of RSUs (In thousands)\",\"2\":\"Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value PerShare\"},{\"1\":\"4302\",\"2\":\"$

stock on the date of grant.\n\nEmployees who are granted RSUs receive the right to receive shares of stock after completion of the vesting period; however, the shares are not issued and the employees cannot sell or transfer shares prior to vesting and have no voting rights until the RSUs vest, generally three years from the date of the award.\n\nEmployees who are granted RSUs receive dividend-equivalent cash payments only upon vesting.\n\nFor these RSU awards, the grant-date fair value is equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant less a discount to reflect the delay in payment of dividend-equivalent cash payments.\n\nWe recognize the grant-date fair value of RSUs, less estimated forfeitures, as compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period, which beginning with the RSUs granted in 2013 is shorter than the vesting period if the employee is retirement eligible on the date of grant or will become retirement eligible before the end of the vesting period.\n\nITEM 6 SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA The following table summarizes certain selected consolidated financial data for, and as of the end of, each of the fiscal years in the

results of our international operations are affected by changes in exchange rates between currencies.\n\nChanges in exchange rates may negatively affect our consolidated net revenue and gross profit margins from international operations.\n\nWe are exposed to the risk that the dollar value equivalent of anticipated cash flows would be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nWe manage this risk through foreign currency option contracts.\n\nStock-Based Compensation Costs We have granted stock options to personnel, including officers and directors, under our 2006 Incentive Award Plan, as amended (the “2006 Plan”).\n\nThese options have expiration dates of seven years from the date of grant and vest over four years.\n\nWe granted these options with the exercise price equal to the market value as determined at the date of grant.\n\nWe have also offered to our personnel, including officers and directors, the right to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount under our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”).\n\nAs of July 1, 2005, we adopted SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective method, which requires measurement of compensation expense of all stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest.\n\nUnder this method, the provisions of SFAS 123(R) apply to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption.\n\nIn addition, the unrecognized expense of awards not yet vested at the date of adoption, determined under the original provisions of SFAS No.123 shall be recognized in net income in the periods after adoption.\n\nThe fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model.\n\nSuch value is recognized as expense over the service period, using the graded\u0002attribution method for stock-based awards granted prior to July 1, 2005 and the straight-line method for stock-based awards granted after July 1, 2005.\n\nThe fair value of stock options granted under our stock option plans and purchase rights granted under our ESPP is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, assuming no dividends and the following assumptions:\n\n## Table 2 ##\n[{\"1\":\"Years ended June 30\",\"2\":\"Years ended June 30\",\"3\":\"Years ended June

interrelation of Applied’s operations, properties within a country may be shared by the segments operating within that country.\n\nThe Company’s headquarters offices are in Santa Clara, California.\n\nProducts in Semiconductor Systems are manufactured in Santa Clara, California; Austin, Texas; Gloucester, Massachusetts; Kalispell, Montana; Rehovot, Israel; and Singapore.\n\nRemanufactured equipment products in the Applied Global Services segment are produced primarily in Austin, Texas.\n\nProducts in the Display and Adjacent Markets segment are manufactured in Alzenau, Germany; and Tainan, Taiwan.\n\nOther products are manufactured in Treviso, Italy.\n\nApplied also owns and leases offices, plants and warehouse locations in many locations throughout the world, including in Europe, Japan, North America (principally the United States), Israel, China, India, Korea, Southeast Asia and Taiwan.\n\nThese facilities are principally used for manufacturing; research, development and engineering; and marketing, sales and customer support.\n\nApplied also owns a total of approximately 269 acres of buildable land in Montana, Texas, California, Israel and Italy that could accommodate additional building space.\n\nApplied considers the properties that it owns or leases as adequate to meet its current and future requirements.\n\nApplied regularly assesses the size, capability and location of its global infrastructure and periodically makes adjustments based on these assessments.\n\nGeneral and administrative expense, which excludes integration charges, decreased $42 million, or 3%, to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $1.3 billion for the prior year primarily due to continued expense controls, partially offset by an increase of approximately $19 million related to higher performance fee-related compensation.\n\nAnnuities Our Annuities segment provides variable and fixed annuity products of RiverSource Life companies to individual clients.\n\nWe provide our variable annuity products through our advisors, and fixed annuity products are provided through both affiliated and unaffiliated advisors and financial institutions.\n\nRevenues for our variable annuity products are primarily earned as fees based on underlying account balances, which are impacted by both market movements and net asset flows.\n\nRevenues for our fixed annuity products are primarily earned as net investment income on assets supporting fixed account balances, with profitability significantly impacted by the spread between net investment income earned and interest credited on the fixed account balances.\n\nWe also earn net investment income on owned assets supporting reserves for immediate annuities and for certain guaranteed benefits offered with variable annuities and on capital supporting the business.\n\nIntersegment revenues for this segment reflect fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of variable insurance trust funds (‘‘VIT Funds’’) under the variable annuity contracts.\n\nIntersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management

31, 2012 compared to $625 million for the prior year primarily due to a decline in net investment income and an unfavorable impact from unlocking and model changes, partially offset by the market impact on DAC and DSIC, lower interest credited to fixed accounts and higher fee revenues.\n\nResults for 2011 included $34 million of additional bond discount accretion investment income related to prior periods resulting from revisions to the accounting classification of certain structured securities, net of DAC and DSIC amortization.\n\nThe impact of unlocking and model changes was a decrease to pretax operating income of $11 million in 2012 compared to an increase of $1 million in the prior year.\n\nThe impact of unlocking and model changes for 2012 included a $43 million benefit, net of DAC and DSIC amortization, from an adjustment to the model which values the reserves related to living benefit guarantees primarily attributable to prior periods.\n\nThis revision aligns the model to more accurately reflect best estimate assumptions for living benefit utilization going forward.\n\nThe market impact on DAC and DSIC was a benefit of $29 million in 2012 compared to an expense of $10 million in the prior year.\n\nRiverSource variable annuity account balances increased 9% to $68.1 billion at December 31, 2012 compared to the prior year driven by market appreciation.\n\nVariable

contractholder funds on the consolidated statements of financial position.\n\nCredit Derivatives Sold When we sell credit protection, we are exposed to the underlying credit risk similar to purchasing a fixed maturity security instrument.\n\nThe majority of our credit derivative contracts sold reference a single name or reference security (referred to as ‘‘single name credit default swaps’’).\n\nThe remainder of our credit derivatives reference either a basket or index of securities.\n\nThese instruments are either referenced in an over-the-counter credit derivative transaction, or embedded within an investment structure that has been fully consolidated into our financial statements.\n\nThese credit derivative transactions are subject to events of default defined within the terms of the contract, which normally consist of bankruptcy, failure to pay, or modified restructuring of the reference entity and/or issue.\n\nIf a default event occurs for a reference name or security, we are obligated to pay the counterparty an amount equal to the notional amount of the credit derivative transaction.\n\nAs a result, our maximum future payment is equal to the notional amount of the credit derivative.\n\nIn certain cases, we also have purchased credit protection with identical underlyings to certain of our sold protection transactions.\n\nThe effect of this purchased protection would reduce our total maximum future payments by $47.0 million and $60.8 million as of December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, respectively.\n\nThese credit derivative transactions had a net fair value of $2.4 million and $21.2 million as of December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, respectively.\n\nOur potential loss could also be reduced by any amount recovered in the default proceedings of the underlying credit name.\n\nWe purchased certain investment structures with embedded credit features that are fully consolidated into our financial statements.\n\nThis consolidation results in recognition of the underlying credit derivatives and collateral within the structure, typically high quality fixed maturity securities that are owned by a special purpose vehicle.\n\nThese credit derivatives reference a single name or several names in a basket structure.\n\nIn the event of default, the collateral within the structure would typically be liquidated to pay the claims of the credit derivative counterparty.\n\nQorvo, Inc.  and Subsidiaries Annual Report on Form 10-K 2019 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements income to substantially offset the losses earned in prior years.\n\nThe balance of the cumulative pre-tax book loss was expected to be offset by income in the first half of fiscal 2018 as production at the assembly and test facility continued to increase as the Company reduced its dependence on outside assembly and test subcontractors.\n\nAfter evaluating the positive and negative evidence, management determined that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets of this China manufacturing subsidiary would be realized and a valuation allowance would not be provided as of the end of fiscal 2017.\n\nAs of March 30, 2019, the Company had federal loss carryovers of approximately $39.6 million that expire in fiscal years 2020 to 2030 if unused and state losses of approximately $105.2 million that expire in fiscal years 2020 to 2039 if unused.\n\nFederal research credits of $127.6 million, and state credits of $64.9 million may expire in fiscal years 2020 to 2039 and 2020 to 2037, respectively.\n\nForeign losses in the Netherlands of approximately $5.1 million expire in fiscal years 2020 to 2027.\n\nIncluded in the amounts above may be certain net operating losses and other tax attribute assets acquired in conjunction with acquisitions in the current and prior years.\n\nThe utilization of acquired domestic assets is subject to certain annual limitations as required under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) and similar state income tax provisions.\n\nThe Company has continued to expand its operations and increase its investments in numerous international jurisdictions.\n\nThese activities expose the Company to taxation in multiple foreign jurisdictions.\n\nIt is management’s opinion that current and future undistributed foreign earnings will be permanently reinvested, except for the earnings of Qorvo International Pte.\n\nLtd. , our operating subsidiary in Singapore.\n\nNo provision for U. S.  federal income, state income or foreign local withholding taxes has been made with respect to the undistributed earnings of any other foreign subsidiary.\n\nIt is not practical to estimate the additional tax that would be incurred, if any, if the permanently reinvested earnings were repatriated.\n\nThe Company has foreign subsidiaries with tax holiday agreements in Singapore and Costa Rica.\n\nThese tax holiday agreements have varying rates and expire in December 2021 and March 2024, respectively.\n\nIncentives from these countries are subject to the Company meeting certain employment and investment requirements.\n\nThe Company does not expect that the Singapore legislation enacted in February 2017, which will exclude from the Company’s existing Development and Expansion Incentive grant the benefit of the reduced tax rate for intellectual property income earned after June 30, 2021, will have an impact on the Company.\n\nIncome tax expense decreased by $34.6 million (an impact of approximately $0.28 and $0.27 per basic and diluted share, respectively) in fiscal 2019 and $7.9 million (an impact of approximately $0.06 per basic and diluted share) in fiscal 2018 as a result of these agreements.\n\nThe Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits totaled $103.2 million as of March 30, 2019, $122.8 million as of March 31, 2018, and $90.6 million as of April 1, 2017.\n\nOf these amounts, $99.1 million (net of federal benefit of state taxes), $118.7 million (net of federal benefit of state taxes) and $84.4 million (net of federal benefit of state taxes) as of March 30, 2019, March 31, 2018, and April 1, 2017, respectively, represent the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate in each of the fiscal years.\n\nThe Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits decreased from $122.8 million as of March 31, 2018 to $103.2 million as of March 30, 2019, primarily due to lapses of statutes of limitations, the conclusion of examinations by U. S.  and Singapore tax authorities, the finalization of Regulations related to the Transitional Repatriation Tax, and finalization of the provisional estimates related to the impact of the Tax Act.\n\nA reconciliation of fiscal 2017 through fiscal 2019 beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):\n\n## Table 2 ##\n<table><tr><td></td><td

thousands, except share and per share data) 10.\n\nCommitments and Contingencies a.\n\nLeases Most of our leased facilities are leased under various operating leases that typically have initial lease terms of ten to fifteen years.\n\nA majority of these leases have renewal options with one or more five year options to extend and may have fixed or Consumer Price Index escalation clauses.\n\nWe also lease equipment under operating leases, primarily computers which have an average lease life of three years.\n\nVehicles and office equipment are also leased and have remaining lease lives ranging from one to seven years.\n\nDue to the declining economic environment in 2008, the current fair market values of vans, trucks and mobile shredding units within our vehicle fleet portfolio, which we lease, have declined.\n\nAs a result, certain vehicle leases that previously met the requirements to be considered operating leases were classified as capital leases upon renewal.\n\nThe 2008 impact of this change on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008 was an increase in property, plant and equipment and debt of $58,517 and had no impact on 2008 operating results.\n\nFuture operating results will have lower vehicle rent expense (a component of transportation costs within cost of sales), offset by an increased amount of combined depreciation and interest expense in future periods.\n\nTotal rent expense (including common area maintenance charges) under all of our operating leases was $207,760, $240,833 and $280,360 (including $20,828 associated with vehicle leases which became capital leases in 2008) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively.\n\nIncluded in total rent expense was sublease income of $3,740, $4,973 and $5,341 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively.\n\nEstimated minimum future lease payments (excluding common area maintenance charges) include payments for certain renewal periods at our option because failure to renew results in an economic disincentive due to significant capital expenditure costs (e. g. , racking), thereby making it reasonably assured that we will renew the lease.\n\nSuch payments in effect at December 31, are as follows:\n\n## Table 3 ##\n<table><tr><td> Year</td><td> Operating Lease Payment</td><td> Sublease Income</td><td>Capital

granted with exercise prices equal to the market price of the stock on the date of grant; however, in certain limited instances, options are granted at prices greater than the market price of the stock on the date of grant.\n\nThe majority of our options become exercisable ratably over a period of five years from the date of grant and generally have a contractual life of ten years from the date of grant, unless the holder’s employment is terminated sooner.\n\nCertain of the options we issue become exercisable ratably over a period of ten years from the date of grant and have a contractual life of 12 years from the date of grant, unless the holder’s employment is terminated sooner.\n\nAs of December 31, 2014, ten-year vesting options represented 8.0% of total outstanding options.\n\nCertain of the options we issue become exercisable ratably over a period of three years from the date of grant and have a contractual life of ten years from the date of grant, unless the holder’s employment is terminated sooner.\n\nAs of December 31, 2014, three-year vesting options represented 34.3% of total outstanding options.\n\nOur non-employee directors are considered employees for purposes of our stock option plans and stock option reporting.\n\nOptions granted to our non-employee directors generally become exercisable one year from the date of grant.\n\nOur equity compensation plans generally provide that any unvested options and other awards granted thereunder shall vest immediately if an employee is terminated by the Company, or terminates his or her own employment for good reason (as defined in each plan), in connection with a vesting change in control (as defined in each plan).\n\nOn January 20, 2015, our stockholders approved the adoption of the Iron Mountain Incorporated 2014 Stock and Cash Incentive Plan (the ‘‘2014 Plan’’).\n\nUnder the 2014 Plan, the total amount of shares of common stock reserved and available for issuance pursuant to awards granted under the 2014 Plan is 7,750,000.\n\nThe 2014 Plan permits the Company to continue to grant awards through January 20, 2025.\n\nA total of 43,253,839 shares of common stock have been reserved for grants of options and other rights under our various stock incentive plans, including the 2014 Plan.\n\nThe number of shares available for grant under our various stock incentive plans,

(i) fund operating and capital requirements; (ii) pay interest and meet debt maturities; (iii) pay dividends; (iv) fund pension and postretirement welfare obligations; and (v) fund acquisitions.\n\nWe invest a significant amount of cash on regulated capital projects where we expect to earn a long-term return on investment.\n\nAdditionally, we operate in rate-regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited, and where such recovery takes place over an extended period of time, as our recovery is subject to regulatory lag.\n\nSee Item 1—Business—Operating Segments—Regulated Businesses—Economic Regulation and Rate Making Process.\n\nWe expect to fund future maturities of long-term debt through a combination of external debt and, to the extent available, cash flows from operations.\n\nSince we expect our capital investments over the next few years to be greater than or equal to our cash flows from operating activities, we have no plans to reduce debt significantly.\n\nIf necessary, the Company may delay certain capital investments or other funding requirements or pursue financing from other sources to preserve liquidity, if necessary.\n\nIn this event, we believe we can rely upon cash flows from operations to meet our obligations and fund our minimum required capital investments for an extended period of time.\n\nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities Cash flows provided by operating activities primarily result from the sale of water and wastewater services and, due to the seasonality of demand, are generally greater during the third quarter of each fiscal year.\n\nOur future cash flows provided by operating activities will be affected by, among other things, economic utility regulation; infrastructure investment; inflation; compliance with environmental, health and safety standards; production costs; customer growth; declining customer usage of water; employee-related costs, including pension funding; weather and seasonality; and overall economic conditions.\n\nCash flows provided by operating activities have been a reliable, steady source of funding, sufficient to meet operating requirements, make our dividend payments and fund a portion of our capital expenditure requirements.\n\nWe expect to seek access to debt capital markets to meet the balance of our capital expenditure requirements as needed.\n\nWe also have access to equity capital markets, if needed.\n\nOperating cash flows can be negatively affected by changes in our rate regulated environments or changes in our customers’ economic outlook and ability to pay for service in a timely manner.\n\nAs such, our working capital needs are primarily limited to funding increases in customer accounts receivable and unbilled revenues mainly associated with revenue increases in our Regulated Businesses.\n\nWe can provide no assurance that our customers’ historical payment pattern will continue in the future.\n\nWe address cash timing differences through the liquidity funding mechanisms discussed above.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the major items affecting our cash flows provided by operating activities:\n\n## Table 0 ##\n<table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"3\">For the Years Ended December 31,</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2015</td><td>2014</td><td>2013</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"3\">(In millions)</td></tr><tr><td>Net income</td><td>$476</td><td>$423</td><td>$369</td></tr><tr><td>Add (less):</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Non-cash activities(a)</td><td>773</td><td>723</td><td>762</td></tr><tr><td>Changes in working capital(b)</td><td>-13</td><td>3</td><td>-137</td></tr><tr><td>Pension and postretirement benefit contributions</td><td>-57</td><td>-52</td><td>-98</td></tr><tr><td>Net cash flows provided by operating activities</td><td>$1,179</td><td>$1,097</td><td>$896</td></tr></table>\n\nBaker Hughes, a GE company Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\n\n## Table 1 ##\n<table><tr><td>(In millions, except per share amounts)</td><td>2017</td><td>2016</td><td>2015</td></tr><tr><td>Net income (loss)</td><td>$-242</td><td>$334</td><td>$-631</td></tr><tr><td>Less: Net income (loss) attributable to GE O&G pre-merger</td><td>109</td><td>403</td><td>-606</td></tr><tr><td>Less: Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests</td><td>-278</td><td>-69</td><td>-25</td></tr><tr><td>Net loss attributable to BHGE</td><td>$-73</td><td>$—</td><td>$—</td></tr><tr><td>Weighted average shares outstanding:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Class A basic & diluted</td><td>427</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Net loss per share attributable to common stockholders:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Class A basic & diluted</td><td>$-0.17</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>\n\nThe allocation of net loss to holders of shares of Class A common stock began following the close of the Transactions on July 3, 2017.\n\nTherefore, the earnings per share is Nil for 2016 and 2015.\n\nPlease refer to \"Note 2.

common stock and units of BHGE LLC for Class A common stock on a one-for\u0002one basis (subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the Exchange Agreement) or, at the option of BHGE, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate value of the shares of Class A common stock that would have otherwise been received by GE in the exchange.\n\nIn computing the dilutive effect, if any, that the aforementioned exchange would have on net income (loss) per share, net income (loss) attributable to holders of Class A common stock would be adjusted due to the elimination of the noncontrolling interests associated with the Class B common stock (including any tax impact).\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, such exchange is not reflected in diluted net income (loss) per share as the assumed exchange is not dilutive.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we excluded outstanding stock options and RSUs from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share because their effect is antidilutive.\n\nShares of our Class B common stock do not share in earnings or losses of the Company and are not considered in the calculation of basic or diluted earnings per share (EPS).\n\nAs such, separate presentation of basic and diluted EPS of Class B under the two class method has not been presented.\n\nNOTE 14.\n\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

purchase shares of common stock were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share as the exercise prices of these options were greater than the average market price of the common stock.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, an average of 3.1 million and 7.6 million options, respectively, were not included.\n\nDuring 2008, we repurchased approximately 10.8 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $68.72 per share for a total cash outlay of $737.0 million, including commissions.\n\nIn April 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a $1.25 billion share repurchase program which expires December 31, 2009.\n\nApproximately $1.13 billion remains authorized under this plan.14.\n\nSEGMENT DATA We design, develop, manufacture and market orthopaedic and dental reconstructive implants, spinal implants, trauma products and related surgical products which include surgical supplies and instruments designed to aid in orthopaedic surgical procedures and post-operation rehabilitation.\n\nWe also provide other healthcare-related services.\n\nRevenue related to these services currently represents less than 1 percent of our total net sales.\n\nWe manage operations through three major geographic segments – the Americas, which is comprised principally of the United States and includes other North, Central and South American markets; Europe, which is comprised principally of Europe and includes the Middle East and Africa; and Asia Pacific, which is comprised primarily of Japan and includes other Asian and Pacific markets.\n\nThis structure is the basis for our reportable segment information discussed below.\n\nManagement evaluates operating segment performance based upon segment operating profit exclusive of operating expenses pertaining to global operations and corporate expenses, share-based compensation expense, settlement, certain claims, acquisition, integration and other expenses, inventory step-up, in-process research and development write-offs and intangible asset amortization expense.\n\nGlobal operations include research, development engineering, medical education, brand management, corporate legal, finance, and human resource functions, and U. S.  and Puerto Rico-based manufacturing operations and logistics.\n\nIntercompany transactions have been eliminated from segment operating profit.\n\nManagement reviews accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets by reportable segment exclusive of U.\n\nS and Puerto Rico-based manufacturing operations and logistics and corporate assets."], "label": "AMBIG", "category": "MultiHiertt", "additional_info": {"original_label": "NS"}}

assets acquired                      | $336                 |\n\nSubsequent to the closing, Entergy received approximately $6 million from Consumers Energy Company as part of the Post-Closing Adjustment defined in the Asset Sale Agreement.\n\nThe Post-Closing Adjustment amount resulted in an approximately $6 million reduction in plant and a corresponding reduction in other liabilities.\n\nFor the PPA, which was at below-market prices at the time of the acquisition, Non-Utility Nuclear will amortize a liability to revenue over the life of the agreement.\n\nThe amount that will be amortized each period is based upon the difference between the present value calculated at the date of acquisition of each year's difference between revenue under the agreement and revenue based on estimated market prices.\n\nAmounts amortized to revenue were $53 million in 2009, $76 million in 2008, and $50 million in 2007.\n\nThe amounts to be amortized to revenue for the next five years will be $46 million for 2010, $43 million for 2011, $17 million in 2012, $18 million for 2013, and $16 million for 2014.\n\nNYPA Value Sharing Agreements Non-Utility Nuclear's purchase of the FitzPatrick and Indian Point 3 plants from NYPA included value sharing agreements with NYPA.\n\nIn October 2007, Non-Utility Nuclear and NYPA amended and restated the value sharing agreements to clarify and amend certain provisions of the original terms.\n\nUnder the amended value sharing agreements, Non-Utility Nuclear will make annual payments to NYPA based on the generation output of the Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick plants from January 2007 through December 2014.\n\nNon-Utility Nuclear will pay NYPA $6.59 per MWh for power sold from Indian Point 3, up to an annual cap of $48 million, and $3.91 per MWh for power sold from FitzPatrick, up to an annual cap of $24 million.\n\nThe annual payment for each year's output is due by January 15 of the following year.\n\nNon-Utility Nuclear will record its liability for payments to NYPA as power is generated and sold by Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick.\n\nAn amount equal to the liability will be recorded to the plant asset account as contingent purchase price consideration for the plants.\n\nIn 2009, 2008, and 2007, Non-Utility Nuclear recorded $72 million as plant for generation during each of those years.\n\nThis amount will be depreciated over the expected remaining useful life of the plants.\n\nIn August 2008, Non-Utility Nuclear entered into a resolution of a dispute with NYPA over the applicability of the value sharing agreements to its FitzPatrick and Indian Point 3 nuclear power plants after the planned spin-off of the Non-Utility Nuclear business.\n\nUnder the resolution, Non-Utility Nuclear agreed not to treat the separation as a \"Cessation Event\" that would terminate its obligation to make the payments under the value sharing agreements.\n\nAs a result, after the spin-off transaction, Enexus will continue to be obligated to make payments to NYPA under the amended and restated value sharing agreements.\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Dollar amounts in thousands except

believed to be the best use of Torchmark’s excess cash flows.\n\nShare repurchases under this program were 5.6 million shares at a cost of $320 million in 2006, 5.6 million shares at a cost of $300 million in 2005, and 5.2 million shares at a cost of $268 million in 2004.\n\nWhen stock options are exercised, proceeds from the exercises are generally used to repurchase approximately the number of shares available with those funds, in order to reduce dilution.\n\nShares repurchased for dilution purposes were 415 thousand shares at a cost of $24 million in 2006, 4.7 million shares costing $255 million in 2005, and 313 thousand shares at a cost of $17 million in 2004.\n\nRetirement of Treasury Stock: Torchmark retired 5 million shares of treasury stock in December, 2006, 4 million in 2005, and 5 million in 2004.\n\nRestrictions: Restrictions exist on the flow of funds to Torchmark from its insurance subsidiaries.\n\nStatutory regulations require life insurance subsidiaries to maintain certain minimum amounts of capital and surplus.\n\nDividends from insurance subsidiaries of Torchmark are limited to the greater of statutory net gain from operations, excluding capital gains and losses, on an annual noncumulative basis, or 10% of surplus, in the absence of special regulatory approval.\n\nAdditionally, insurance company distributions are generally not permitted in excess of statutory surplus.\n\nSubsidiaries are also subject to certain minimum capital requirements.\n\nIn 2006, subsidiaries of Torchmark paid $428 million in dividends to the parent company.\n\nDuring 2007, a maximum amount of $434 million is expected to be available to Torchmark from subsidiaries without regulatory approval.\n\nPART I ITEM 1.

He trains Shutthefrontdoor for his principal patron J P McManus, who owns Jackdaws Castle and retains AP McCoy, the record-breaking Jump jockey who is about to gain his 20th consecutive jockeys' championship and retire. McCoy has not decided yet whether he is riding Shutthefrontdoor in the £1million Crabbie's Grand National at Aintree on  April 11, but everything points to him doing so. Jonjo O'Neill hopes jockey AP McCoy rides Shutthefrontdoor to Grand National success later this month O'Neill told Betfred: 'Shutthefrontdoor is in great form. I could not be happier with him. I would have liked to have got a run into him (before the Grand National) but he had an abscess on his sinus in January/February time which took a while to find out where it was. 'We did think about giving him at run at Cheltenham (at the Festival in March) but decided not to. I think he is a better horse on a flat track and secondly I did not want to give him a hard race at a time when he wasn't as well as he is now. He is schooling well and is spot on. 'He is a clean-winded horse, who is not hard to get ready. He was ready to run and win first time out at Carlisle. He is going to Aintree fresh and well. It is all down to AP now if he is going ride him. 'You need to have a good classy horse for the National. Before, you needed a good jumper and a lot of luck, now it is a proper race. Aintree has done a great job with the track and the fences are first class. 'He likes to be up there and hopefully in the first half of the runners - that at least is my plan. If he got luck in running over the first mile, I would ride him myself. 'I don't bet so it does not make any difference to me what price he is - I am just training the horse as though he was going for a little race at Stratford or whatever! This year's Grand National will be McCoy's last-ever at Aintree before his retirement at the end of the season 'Hopefully, AP is going to ride Shutthefrontdoor and the public will want to back him, looking for a fairytale story. We would all love that to happen, but it is a tall order. 'The only pressure (on me) is that Shutthefrontdoor gets there safe and sound. He is in the best form I can possibly get him. I would be more nervous if we had hiccups now but we had them in January and February. If he doesn't win, we can blame whoever rides him! 'I'd love good ground at Aintree - he is a well-balanced horse and a great mover. He does not want it too soft. Perfect jumping ground is ideal. They make a good job of the ground at Aintree - we just don't want the heavens to open. He is as good as any horse in the National. 'We are going there full of confidence, but you have got to be realistic - it is the National.' Don't Push It gave O'Neill, McManus and McCoy their first Grand National victory in 2010. O'Neill continued: 'This preparation has gone better than Don't Push It's. Don't Push It was a bit of a law unto himself. Alan Berry has done all the work with this horse, like he did with Don't Push It. We think we have got it all right and are very happy with the way things have gone. Shutthefrontdoor, pictured with O'Neill (right) is the favourite for the race on April 11 'Shutthefrontdoor is a lovely horse - a real old pet - and loves racing, while the other horse was half-mad, a character. 'He lacks experience as a jumper but I think he is quite clever, pretty accurate and knows what he is doing. If he does take to the fences, he will run a blinder. 'I have taken him away (to racecourses) a couple of times so he is not too fresh. I don't want him to be too fresh over the first couple of fences. I used to build three or four National fences every year but one year we didn't and that was the year Don't Push It won so we haven't since. The Grand National fences are now really inviting. 'The Grand National grips you and is magic to be involved in. 'We will miss AP not riding in races next season but hopefully he is still going to be involved. We are not going to let him off the hook that easily - we may drag him in for schooling.' O'Neill envisages a team of between eight and 12 running at Aintree during the three days of the Crabbie's Grand National Festival (April 9 - 11). 'Holywell will run in the Betfred Bowl (April 9) after a great run (fourth) in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. He was beaten fair and square - the ground went against us a bit. He put a lot of effort into his jumping and did not quite get home. 'He came out of the race a bit tired for the first week to 10 days but is absolutely flying now and did a lovely bit of work yesterday [Wednesday] morning. He came alive there last year and seems to like the track.'"], "label": "AMBIG", "category": "AggreFact-CNN", "additional_info": {"original_label": "NS"}}

When Daily Mail Online knocked on the apartment door a dog barked loudly and after a pause a woman said: 'Hello?' Asked for comment she said: 'I'm unavailable at the moment'.

He said: 'It happens three or four times a week though I'm at school in the day so it could be more. 'They usually go at it for 10 to 15 minutes and I hear them all over the apartment. 'Sometimes it's the bedroom and sometimes it's in the lobby by the front door.' Another neighbor said: 'It's really loud. 'I have to put on music because you can hear everything.' The building owner Madelene Behefte, 73, said she had no idea about the complaints. She said: 'People should call the landlord before calling the city to complain'.

Justus Howell was gunned down from behind by an officer in Zion, Illinois on Saturday afternoon after officers were called to reports of an argument. The chief of the Zion Police Department has now said that the argument was in fact a scuffle over a handgun - during which the firearm went off and Howell allegedly pointed it at another teenager. Killed: Justus Howell, 17, was shot twice in the back by police in Zion, Illinois, on Saturday afternoon. 'Stole a handgun': Police say that Howell had just taken a weapon from Tramond Peet, 18, who was trying to sell it to him. Steve Dumyahn said Howell was struggling over a gun with Tramond Peet, 18, and started running when police showed up. Peet told officers he met Howell with the intention of selling him the gun - but Howell tried to snatch it without paying. He then claimed the two tussled over the weapon, which was fired into the ground. At one point, he said, Howell was pointing it at him. Peet told investigators that he let go of the gun when he heard sirens. He said Howell ran and that he heard officers shouting instructions, then opening fire. An autopsy on Howell revealed that he was hit by two bullets, both from behind. Aftermath: Investigators are pictured above at the scene of the shooting, which took place around 2pm . One his his left side and penetrated his heart, spleen and liver. The second hit him on the right side of his back. Tests to see whether there were drugs in Howell's body are not finished yet.

Dumyahn said the officer who shot Howell is a nine-year veteran, and is now on administrative leave. . He did not release the officer's name or any additional information about him, including his race. Lake County NAACP president Jennifer Witherspoon said his relatives have asked her organization to speak on their behalf. Witherspoon said authorities told the NAACP that they have videotape of the scuffle between Peet and Howell but can't yet say what led the officer to shoot Howell. She said Howell's relatives are hoping to find out exactly what happened as quickly as possible. She said: 'Whether it was a mistake on his part or a mistake on the police's part, they want answers to make sure something like this never happens again'. Howell's death is the latest in a series of unarmed black men being killed by police officers - the most high-profile example of which was the death of Michael Brown at the hands of Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri. .

It was the largest drug smuggling operation yet uncovered at the airport. Captagon pills, which typically contain amphetamine and caffeine, are consumed widely in the Middle East. The drug has helped fuel the conflict in Syria, generating millions of dollars in revenue for producers inside the country as well as being used by combatants to help them keep fighting. NNA reported that 40 bags of Captagon pills were found by inspectors from the Gendarmerie in cases due to be put on board a jet bound for Hael, in northern Saudi Arabia. It did not identify the Saudi citizens who were detained, but sources told the Associated Press and the AFP news agency that they included a Saudi prince. In April 2014, Lebanese security forces foiled an attempt to smuggle 15 million Captagon pills hidden in shipping containers full of corn from Beirut's seaport, according to AFP. Captagon, originally the trade name for the synthetic stimulant fenetylline, was first produced in the 1960s to treat hyperactivity, narcolepsy and depression.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "The Court also found that evidence unlawfully seized by a school official should be allowed in as evidence at juvenile delinquency proceedings.", "reference_documents": ["Legally Reviewed\nFact-Checked\nMany of the Supreme Court's most notable cases involve the constitutional rights of students in public schools. In New Jersey v. T.L.O. , decided in 1985, the Supreme Court took up the issue of when school officials can search students' personal belongings. Do students have Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures by teachers and school staff? Or do students not have a reasonable expectation of privacy while in school?\nThis question lingers in various forms to this day. For example, what right do schools have to search students' phones? This body of law is still being developed. What was clear after New Jersey v. T.L.O. , however, is that a student's Fourth Amendment rights are not left entirely at the door of the school. However, the Court held students have less of an expectation of privacy at school than in other places.\nThe underlying circumstances surrounding New Jersey v. T.L.O. are not particularly unusual. In the early 1980s, a high school teacher discovered two girls smoking in the bathroom. This, of course, was a violation of school rules. Although one 14-year-old student, T.L.O., denied she had been smoking, the teacher didn't buy it and brought them both to the principal's office. A vice principal at the school, suspecting T.L.O. had cigarettes, asked to see T.L.O.'s purse. The vice principal found marijuana papers alongside a pack of cigarettes, which led to a more thorough search of T.L.O.'s purse. He discovered a significant amount of cash, a small amount of marijuana, and a list of students who owed T.L.O money. Since these items indicated the student was selling marijuana to classmates, the school contacted the police. Ultimately, T.L.O. confessed to police and was charged in juvenile court for selling marijuana in school.\nT.L.O. argued that the school violated her Fourth Amendment rights when searching her purse. Because the evidence was obtained in violation of her rights, she argued, the list, cash, and papers could not be admitted as evidence, and her confession should be thrown out as well since it came from an unlawful search. The lower state court sided with the school, but the New Jersey Supreme Court sided with T.L.O. in finding that the search was unreasonable.\nBefore getting into the Supreme Court's decision, it helps to understand certain aspects of search and seizure law. Namely, the exclusionary rule and probable cause.\nThe exclusionary rule developed in the early 20th century. Under this Supreme Court doctrine, evidence found in violation of a person's Fourth Amendment right is not admissible in court. The first case to use this doctrine was the 1914 decision Weeks v. United States .\nIt's an important doctrine because the outcome of many criminal cases is determined by the exclusionary rule. If a criminal defendant can successfully argue that officers did not have probable cause to conduct a search, then the case against the defendant usually falls apart. If, however, the state can show probable cause, then the evidence is admissible, and the defendant may have a hard time defending their case.\nThe Fourth Amendment prohibits the government, including law enforcement, from conducting unreasonable searches and seizures on U.S. citizens. Fourth Amendment law can be extremely complex, and exceptions and gray areas exist, but essentially police cannot search a person without probable cause. They also cannot search a place where a person would have a reasonable expectation of privacy without probable cause or first obtaining a search warrant from a court.\nLaw enforcement officers have probable cause for a search when they have a reasonable suspicion that a person has committed or is committing a crime. Similarly, law enforcement officers can search private spaces, such as homes, if they obtain a warrant after showing to a judge they reasonably expect to find specific items connected with a crime, or if one of the exceptions such as the \"plain sight\" doctrine applies.\nAgain, this is a complicated area of the law, but these are the basics of search and seizure law. In New Jersey v. T.L.O. , the court had to decide if:\n- The Fourth Amendment applies to students in a public school\n- The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches by teachers, as well as law enforcement officers\n- Students have a legitimate expectation of privacy in school\n- The vice principal's search of T.L.O.'s purse was unreasonable\nThe Supreme Court justices all agreed on some parts of the decision, but three (Justices Brennan, Marshall, and Stevens) dissented in part.\nThe Court unanimously held that students have a Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable search and seizure while in school. What's more, that prohibition extends to teachers and school staff. According to Justice White, who wrote the majority opinion, \". . . this Court has never limited the Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures to operations conducted by the police.\" Put simply, no teacher, staff, or police officer can conduct random or unsubstantiated searches of students.\nHowever, the majority decision held that schools did not need the same level of probable cause as police officers for conducting searches. This is because students do not have the same expectation of privacy as citizens have in their homes. Instead, the majority established the following test to determine the reasonableness of a school's search of a student:\n- The search is \"justified at its inception\" and\n- The search is \"reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place\"\nA school's search of a student is justified at its inception if there are reasonable grounds for suspecting a student has broken the law or school rules. The search is appropriate in scope if it is not \"excessively intrusive\" considering the student's age and the rule or law the school believes the student has violated. This is similar, but not identical, to the standard the law places on police searches. It is a somewhat lowered standard, replacing \"probable cause\" with \"reasonable suspicion.\"\nOnce it had established the standard, the Supreme Court had to apply it to T.L.O.'s case. Did the school violate T.L.O.'s rights when it searched her purse? This is where the justices disagreed. According to the majority, the school's searches met the above standard of reasonableness. Justice Powell, with Justice O'Connor, agreed with the majority opinion. However, they wrote separately to emphasize that students have less of a privacy expectation in school than others.\nJustice Brennan, with whom Justice Marshall joined, dissented in part. While Justices Brennan and Marshall agreed that students have Fourth Amendment protections, they disagreed with the new standard for searches the majority created. \"In adopting this unclear, unprecedented, and unnecessary departure from generally applicable Fourth Amendment standards, the Court carves out a broad exception to standards that this Court has developed over years of considering Fourth Amendment problems,\" Justice Brennan wrote. Instead, he would have held that the vice principal needed probable cause to search T.L.O.'s purse. In holding the school to the higher and more established probable cause standard, Justices Brennan and Marshall would have upheld the New Jersey Supreme Court's decision finding that the school violated T.L.O.'s Fourth Amendment rights.\nJustice Stevens also wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Marshall and in part by Justice Brennan, holding that the Supreme Court should have limited its decision to whether the exclusionary rule applied in this case. When it first appealed the case to the Supreme Court, the state of New Jersey first only asked the Supreme Court to decide whether the exclusionary rule applied to the decision the New Jersey Supreme Court made. The question of T.L.O.'s Fourth Amendment rights came up later and was the reason the Supreme Court heard oral arguments twice in this case. Justice Stevens would have held the exclusionary rule applied to school searches and left it at that. However, he added a section on the majority's decision, writing that students have the same expectation of privacy for their personal belongings that anyone else has. In other words, Justice Stevens also disagreed with the majority's newly created standard for the lawfulness of school searches.\nAs a result of the decision, school searches of students are very fact-dependent. Courts apply a somewhat different standard than police searches to determine whether the school was justified in conducting a search. As noted above, this question is particularly relevant today, when students carry around significant amounts of personal information in their pocket in the form of smartphones. As one hypothetical, would a school be justified in searching a student's text messages in similar circumstances as T.L.O.'s? While the question to that hypothetical remains unclear, the standard courts would use to determine that question would derive from the standard set in New Jersey v. T.L.O.\nYou can read the full opinion here .\nLearn more about FindLaw’s newsletters, including our terms of use and privacy policy.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nQuestions?\nAt FindLaw.com, we pride ourselves on being the number one source of free legal information and resources on the web.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "There is debate over whether the judiciary should be representative of the society it serves.", "reference_documents": ["This article is more than 7 years old\nWhat percentage of court of appeal and high court judges would you guess are women? What about the proportion of black and minority ethnic (BME) members of the judiciary?\nIf your guess is that the diversity within the judiciary mirrors that within the general population, then the actual figures, published last week with little fanfare, might disappoint you. Just eight out of 38 court of appeal judges and 21 out of 106 high court judges are women. The overall percentage of female judges across the courts is 25%. Of court judges who declared their ethnicity, only 5.9% gave their background as BME. The picture is significantly better in tribunals, however, where 44% of judges are female – although just 9.5% declared their background as BME.\nThe situation isn’t entirely bleak. The statistics suggest gradual change – the percentages are rising slowly, and are higher for younger age groups. Of court judges under 40 years old, 53% are women, compared with just 13% of over-60s. Of court judges in their 40s, 11.3% are BME, compared to just 2.5% of over-60s.\nAlthough this is encouraging, people who fit within those age brackets make up a relatively low proportion of the judiciary. Just 60 out of 3,238 court judges are aged under 40. Change may be happening, but it isn’t happening quickly enough.\nMeanwhile, the makeup of our judiciary remains woefully out of step with the population it exists to serve. As with the under-representation of women in politics, this is arguably one of the professions where diversity matters the most – its members need to understand, as well as reflect, the full range of the society for which they work.\nThe fact that only 29% of MPs are women (22% before the election) takes on particular significance when it becomes clear that recent cuts have hit women hardest, for instance. The Fawcett Society recently reported that a staggering 74% of the money saved from benefit and tax changes since 2010 has come directly from women’s pockets. So, too, the under-representation of BME people within the judiciary should be cause for particular concern, given the fact that offenders from ethnic minorities are more likely than their white counterparts to be sentenced to prison for certain categories of crimes.\nAccording to an analysis of more than 1m court records carried out by the Guardian in 2011 , black offenders were 44% more likely than white offenders to be sentenced to prison for driving offences, 38% more likely to be imprisoned for public disorder or possession of a weapon, and 27% more likely to be imprisoned for drugs possession. Asian offenders were 41% more likely to be sent to prison for drugs offences than their white counterparts and 19% more likely to go to jail for shoplifting.\nA pale, stale, male-dominated legal system also throws up questions given the number of recent cases where members of the judiciary have seemed to suggest victims of rape and violence are partially responsible for their own assault. In February this year, a judge sentencing two men for raping an 18-year-old student said : “Your victim was very unwise to allow herself to drink so much that she became so thoroughly inebriated.” He then described her as “extremely foolish”, before adding: “She became so drunk that she was vulnerable and defenceless to your exploitation.”\nThis judge’s comments came in the same month as the barrister David Osborne wrote a blogpost entitled “She was gagging for it” , in which he decried the “politically driven agenda” that “has been thrust down the throats of court-users about the deplorably low percentage of rape allegations that lead to conviction”. He added: “In my book, consent is consent, blind drunk or otherwise, and regret after the event cannot make it rape.”Then, in April, a day after the body of murdered 21-year-old student Karen Buckley was discovered in Glasgow, a judge adjudicating on a different case (of 21-year-old Leanne Roberts assaulting a woman outside a bar) remarked: “I find it incredible that young people can get so drunk that they don’t even know who they’re with. One only has to think about the horrible situation in Glasgow to see how serious this could have been. It’s very, very worrying how young girls put themselves in such very, very vulnerable positions.” His words came despite the fact that there was no suggestion that Miss Buckley was drunk on the night she died. In July, an Irish judge ruled that a man who regularly raped his heavily medicated girlfriend in her sleep over a period of almost a year should serve no jail time . Why? Because his crime would not have been discovered had he not confessed, saying: “In truth, this case comes here today out of his own mouth.”\nOf course, this is not to suggest that every white judge is racist, or that every male judge blames the survivors of sexual assault for the crimes enacted on them. A variety of different reasons have been suggested for disparities in sentencing , including but not limited to discriminatory sentencing practices. And, indeed, the problem of victim-blaming is not confined to male judges – in January, Joanna Greenberg gave a non-custodial sentence to a teacher convicted on two counts of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust, telling him: “There is no evidence you groomed her. If anything, it was she who groomed you. You gave way to temptation at a time when you were emotionally vulnerable because of problems with your wife’s pregnancy. She was intelligent and used that intelligence to manipulate people emotionally.” Yet, it still bears asking: is a white, male-dominated judiciary fully able to serve justice to a far more diverse community than that represented within its own ranks?\nI hope you appreciated this article.

By comparison,\nweighs 170.6 pounds, has a waist circumference of 38.6 inches, and is just under 5 feet 4 inches (about 63.7 inches) tall.\nHere’s more about why this is happening and what you can do to keep your weight in a healthy range for your stature.\nThe average weight of people in the United States and North America as a whole is higher than any other region in the world.\nIn 2012, BMC Public Health reported the following average weights by region. The averages were calculated using data from 2005, and relied on combined statistics for men and women:\n- North America: 177.9 pounds\n- Oceania, including Australia: 163.4 pounds\n- Europe: 156.1 pounds\n- Latin America/Caribbean: 149.7 pounds\n- Africa: 133.8 pounds\n- Asia: 127.2 pounds\nThe world average for an adult’s weight is 136.7 pounds.\nCompiling average weights is simple enough, but determining a healthy or ideal weight is a little more complicated.\nOne of the most common tools for this is the body mass index (BMI) . BMI uses a formula that involves your height and weight.\nTo calculate your BMI, divide your weight in pounds by your height in inches squared. Multiply that result by 703. You can also enter this information into an\n.\nTo know whether your BMI is normal or if it falls under another category, consult the information below:\nThe BMI isn’t always a perfect tool to gauge whether your weight is in the healthy or normal range.\nAn athlete, for example, may weigh more than a non-athlete of the same height, but be in much better physical condition. That’s because muscle is denser than fat , which contributes to a higher weight.\nGender is also a consideration. Women tend to store more body fat than men. Likewise, older adults tend to carry more body fat and have less muscle mass than younger adults of the same height.\nIf you’re looking for a reasonable estimate of an ideal weight for your height, consider the following table:\n|Height in feet and inches||Healthy weight in pounds|\n|4’10”||88.5–119.2|\n|4’11”||91.6–123.3|\n|5′||94.7–127.5|\n|5’1″||97.9–131.8|\n|5’2″||101.2–136.2|\n|5’3″||104.5–140.6|\n|5’4″||107.8–145.1|\n|5’5″||111.2–149.7|\n|5’6″||114.6–154.3|\n|5’7″||118.1–159|\n|5’8″||121.7–163.8|\n|5’9″||125.3–168.6|\n|5’10”||129–173.6|\n|5’11”||132.7–178.6|\n|6′||136.4–183.6|\n|6’1″||140.2–188.8|\n|6’2″||144.1–194|\n|6’3″||148–199.2|\nOne of the main limitations of BMI is that it doesn’t take a person’s body composition into consideration. A slim man and a broad-shouldered man of the same height may have very different weights but be equally fit.\nThere are other measurements that can give you a more accurate idea of whether or not you’re at a healthy weight.\nOne such measurement is the waist-to-hip ratio . The waist-to-hip ratio is important because weight stored in the abdominal area puts you at a higher risk for certain health conditions, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes .\nMeasurements will be taken at your natural waist (right above your belly button) as well as the widest part of your hips and buttocks.\nIn 2008, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended a maximum waist-to-hip ratio of 0.90 for men and 0.85 for women. Ratios of 1.0 and 0.90, respectively, put men and women at high risk for health problems.\nDespite its overall usefulness, the waist-to-hip ratio isn’t recommended for everyone. Some groups, including children and those with a BMI over 35, may find that other methods provide a more accurate assessment of their fitness.\nThere are a variety of ways to determine your body fat percentage, including skinfold thickness measurements and densitometry. Your doctor or a personal trainer may be able to perform these types of tests.\nOnline calculators can also use measurements such as your height, weight, and wrist circumference to estimate your body fat percentage.\nThe American Council on Exercise (ACE) , an organization for fitness professionals, uses the following classifications for male body fat percentage:\n|Classification||Body fat percentage (%)|\n|Athletes||6–13|\n|Fitness||14–17|\n|Acceptable/Average||18–24|\n|Obese||25 and up|\nMaintaining a healthy weight can help prevent a range of problems, such as:\nIf you need to drop a few pounds to get to your ideal weight, here are some key steps to help get you there:\nInstead of focusing on a large, big-picture goal, aim for a small goal. For example, instead of being set on losing 50 pounds this year, aim for losing a pound a week.\nYour diet should focus mainly on the following foods:\nLimit your consumption of added sugars , alcohol , and saturated fats .\nTry cutting your usual mealtime portions in half. If you typically have two slices of pizza on Saturday night, just have one and some salad. A food journal can help you track what and how much you’re eating.\nAim for 30 to 40 minutes daily or at least 150 minutes per week. Your exercise regimen should include cardio , strength training , and flexibility exercises. You can also work out with a friend or family member to motivate you to get up and move.\nAlthough being 69.1 inches tall and weighing 197.9 pounds may be “average” for an American man, that also indicates a BMI of 29.1 — the high end of the “overweight” classification. Average doesn’t always mean ideal, at least in the United States.\nYou should also keep in mind that there are several different formulas and calculations used to determine ideal weight in relation to height. None of them are perfect. You may be just the right weight for your large frame, even though another measure may label you as overweight.\nHealthy weight isn’t always a guarantee of good health. You can have a normal BMI, but if you smoke and don’t exercise or eat right, you’re still at risk for heart disease and other underlying conditions.\nIf you’re concerned about your health, talk with your doctor .\nThey can help you understand where exactly your weight falls on the spectrum and how this may relate to your overall health. If needed, they can help set a good goal weight for you and work with you on strategies to get there.\nLast medically reviewed on February 27, 2019\nSources\nHistory"], "label": "AMBIG", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": {"original_label": "NS"}}
{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "Norman Borlaug is widely regarded as the \"Father of the Green Revolution\" for his work in developing high-yielding varieties of wheat and other staple crops, which resulted in increased production of food grains and saved over a billion people from starvation.", "reference_documents": ["The Green Revolution , also known as the Third Agricultural Revolution , was a period of technology transfer initiatives that saw greatly increased crop yields and agricultural production. [1] [2] These changes in agriculture began in developed countries after World War II and spread globally till the late 1980s. [3] In the late 1960s, farmers began incorporating new technologies such as high-yielding varieties of cereals, particularly dwarf wheat and rice , and the widespread use of chemical fertilizers (to produce their high yields, the new seeds require far more fertilizer than traditional varieties [4] ), pesticides , and controlled irrigation .\nAgriculture also saw the adoption of newer methods of cultivation, including mechanization . These changes were often implemented as a package of practices meant to replace traditional agricultural technology. [5] These costlier technologies were often provided in conjunction with loans that were conditional on policy changes being made by the developing nations adopting them, such as privatizing fertilizer manufacture and distribution that was formerly done through public channels. [4]\nBoth the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation were heavily involved in its initial development in Mexico. [6] [7] One key leader was agricultural scientist Norman Borlaug , the \"Father of the Green Revolution\", who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970. He is credited with saving over a billion people from starvation. [8] Another important scientific figure was Yuan Longping , whose work on hybrid rice varieties is credited with saving at least as many lives. [9] The basic approach was the development of high-yielding varieties of cereal grains, expansion of irrigation infrastructure, modernization of management techniques, distribution of hybridized seeds , synthetic fertilizers, and pesticides to farmers. As crops began to reach the maximum improvement possible through selective breeding , genetic modification technologies were developed to allow for continued efforts. [10] [11]\nStudies show that the Green Revolution contributed to widespread reduction of poverty, averted hunger for millions, raised incomes, reduced greenhouse gas emissions , reduced land use for agriculture, and contributed to declines in infant mortality. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16]\nAccording to The Limits to Growth the first genetic experiments, which a hundred years later resulted in high-yield agricultural crops, took place in a European monastery. [17]\nThe term \"Green Revolution\" was first used by William S. Gaud, the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), in a speech on 8 March 1968. He noted the spread of the new technologies as:\n\"These and other developments in the field of agriculture contain the makings of a new revolution. It is not a violent Red Revolution like that of the Soviets, nor is it a White Revolution like that of the Shah of Iran . I call it the Green Revolution.\" [4] [18]\nMexico has been called the 'birthplace' and 'burial ground' of the Green Revolution. [19] It began with great promise and it has been argued that \"during the twentieth century two 'revolutions' transformed rural Mexico: the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920) and the Green Revolution (1950–1970).\" [20]\nIt was on the lead of the Mexican government in 1943, under Presidential order and finance of the Mexican President Manuel Ávila Camacho , and support of the U.S. government, the United Nations , the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the Rockefeller Foundation . For the U.S. government, its neighbor Mexico was an important experimental case in the use of technology and scientific expertise in agriculture that became the model for international agricultural development. [21] Mexico made a concerted effort to transform agricultural productivity, particularly with irrigated rather than dry-land cultivation in its northwest, to solve its problem of lack of food self-sufficiency. [22] In the center and south of Mexico, where large-scale production faced challenges, agricultural production languished. [23] Increased production promised food self-sufficiency in Mexico to feed its growing and urbanizing population with the increase in a number of calories consumed per Mexican. [24] The technology was seen as a valuable way to feed the poor and would relieve some pressure of the land redistribution process. [25] In general, the success of \"Green Revolution\" depended on the use of machinery for cultivation and harvest, on large-scale agricultural enterprises with access to credit (often from foreign investors), government-supported infrastructure projects, and access to low-wage agricultural workers. [26]\nMexico was the recipient of knowledge and technology of the Green Revolution, and it was an active participant with financial supports from the government for agriculture and Mexican agronomists. In the aftermath of the Mexican Revolution, the government had redistributed land to peasants in some parts of the country which had broken the back of the hacienda system. During the presidency of Lázaro Cárdenas (1934-1940), land reform in Mexico reached its apex in the center and south of Mexico. Agricultural productivity had fallen significantly by the 1940s. American Vice President Henry A. Wallace , previously president Franklin Delano Roosevelt 's Secretary of Agriculture, visited Mexico who helped in uplifting the research program in Mexico that emphasized in increased productivity rather than land reform. [27]\nDuring the administration of Manuel Ávila Camacho (1940–46), the government put resources into developing new breeds of plants and partnered with the Rockefeller Foundation , and was also supported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture . [28] In 1941, a team of U.S. scientists, Richard Bradfield (Cornell University), Paul C. Mangelsdorf (Harvard University), and Elvin Charles Stakman (University of Minnesota) surveyed Mexican agriculture to recommend policies and practices. [29] Norman Borlaug , a key figure developing Green Revolution practices in Mexico, studied with Stakman at University of Minnesota. [30] In 1943, the Mexican government founded the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), which became a base for international agricultural research.\nAgriculture in Mexico had been a sociopolitical issue, a key factor in some regions' participation in the Mexican Revolution. It was also a technical issue enabled by a cohort of trained agronomists who advised peasants how to increase productivity. [31] In the post-World War II era, the government sought development in agriculture that bettered technological aspects of agriculture in regions—not dominated by small-scale peasant cultivators. This drive for agricultural transformation would have the benefit to Mexico on self-sufficiency in food and in the political sphere during the Cold War (potentially stem unrest and the appeal of Communism). [28] Technical aid can also be seen as serving political ends in the international sphere. In Mexico, it also served political ends separating peasant agriculture based on the ejido and considered one of the victories of the Mexican Revolution, from agribusiness that requires large-scale land ownership, irrigation, specialized seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides, machinery, and a low-wage paid labor force.\nThe Mexican government created the Mexican Agricultural Program (MAP) to be the lead organization in raising productivity. One of their successes was in wheat production with varieties dominating wheat production as early as 1951 (70%), 1965 (80%), and 1968 (90%). [32] Mexico became the showcase for extending the Green Revolution to other areas of Latin America and beyond, into Africa and Asia. New breeds of maize, beans, and wheat produced bumper crops with proper inputs (such as fertilizer and pesticides) and careful cultivation. Many Mexican farmers who had been dubious about the scientists or hostile to them (often a mutual relationship of discord) came to see the scientific approach to agriculture as worth adopting. [33]\nThe requirement for the full package of inputs of new strains of seeds, fertilizer, synthetic pesticides, and water were often not within the reach of small-scale farmers. The application of pesticides could be hazardous for farmers. Their use often damaged the local ecology, contaminating waterways and endangering the health of workers and newborns. [34]\nOne of the participants in the Mexican experiment, Edwin J. Wellhausen , summarized the factors leading to its initial success. These include: high yield plants without disease resistivity, adaptability, and ability to use fertilizers; improved use of soils, adequate fertilizers, and control of weeds and pests; and \"a favorable ratio between the cost of fertilizers (and other investments) to the price of the produce.\" [35]\nIn 1960 the Government of the Republic of the Philippines with the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation established the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). A rice crossing between Dee-Geo-woo-gen and Peta was done at IRRI in 1962. In 1966, one of the breeding lines became a new cultivar : IR8 rice . [36] IR8 required the use of fertilizers and pesticides, but produced substantially higher yields than the traditional cultivars. Annual rice production in the Philippines increased from 3.7 to 7.7 million tons in two decades. [37] The switch to IR8 rice made the Philippines a rice exporter for the first time in the 20th century, [38] though imports still exceeded exports, according to data from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. From 1966 to 1986, the Philippines imported around 2,679,000 metric tons and exported only 632,000 metric tons of milled rice. [39]\nIn 1961, India was on the brink of mass famine. [ additional citation(s) needed ] [40] Norman Borlaug was invited to India by the adviser to the Indian Minister of Agriculture Dr. M. S. Swaminathan . Despite bureaucratic hurdles imposed by India's grain monopolies, the Ford Foundation and Indian government collaborated to import wheat seed from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT). The state of Punjab was selected by the Indian government to be the first site to try the new crops because of its reliable water supply, the presence of Indus plains which make it one of the most fertile plains on earth, and a history of agricultural success. India began its own Green Revolution program of plant breeding, irrigation development, and financing of agrochemicals. [41]\nIndia soon adopted IR8 —a semi-dwarf rice variety developed by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) that could produce more grains of rice per plant when grown with certain fertilizers and irrigation. [42] In 1968, Indian agronomist S.K. De Datta published his findings that IR8 rice yielded about 5 tons per hectare with no fertilizer, and almost 10 tons per hectare under optimal conditions. This was 10 times the yield of traditional rice. [43] IR8 was a success throughout Asia, and dubbed the \"Miracle Rice.\" IR8 was also developed into Semi-dwarf IR36 .\nIn the 1960s, rice yields in India were about two tons per hectare; by the mid-1990s, they had risen to 6 tons per hectare. In the 1970s, rice cost about $550 a ton; in 2001, it cost under $200 a ton. [44] India became one of the world's most successful rice producers, and is now a major rice exporter, shipping nearly 4.5 million tons in 2006.\nChina's Green Revolution came from its own fruition, and cannot necessarily be credited to practices popularized by Norman Borlaug. China's large and increasing population meant that increasing food production, principally rice, was a top priority for the Chinese government. When the People's Republic of China was established in 1949, the Chinese Communist Party made it a priority to pursue agricultural development. [45] They sought to solve China's food security issues by focusing on traditional crop production, the implementation of modern technology and science, creating food reserves for the population, high-yield seed varieties, multi-cropping, controlled irrigation, and protecting food security. [46] [45] [47] This began with the Agrarian Reform Law of 1950, which ended private land ownership and gave land back to the peasants. [45] The beginning of China's Green Revolution is marked by the government's sponsorship of agricultural research, specifically in producing a high-yielding rice variety for the rapidly growing population. [45] These efforts began during the Great Leap Forward , a time from 1959 to 1961 where the Government launched a campaign to reconstruct their agrarian economy into a communist society and established the People's Commune .\nProminent in the development of productive hybrid rice was Yuan Longping , whose research hybridized wild strains of rice with existing strains. He has been dubbed “the father of hybrid rice,” [48] and was considered a national hero in China. [49] Chinese rice production met the nation's food security needs, and today they are a leading exporter of rice. In recent years, however, extensive use of ground water for irrigation has drawn down aquifers and extensive use of fertilizers has increased greenhouse gas emissions. [50] China has not expanded the area of cultivable land, but the Green Revolution with high yields per hectare gave China the food security it sought. [51]\nIn 1979, there were 490 million Chinese people living in poverty. In 2014, there were only 82 million. Half of China's population had once been hungry and in poverty, but by 2014, only 6% remained so. [46] If China's stats were to be excluded entirely from Green Revolution studies, they would find that world hunger actually increased. [46] Unlike in China, where locally grown produce would stay within local markets, the food in other countries was being placed on the global market, never to be eaten by those who grew it.\nBrazil's vast inland cerrado region was regarded as unfit for farming before the 1960s because the soil was too acidic and poor in nutrients, according to Norman Borlaug . However, from the 1960s, vast quantities of lime (pulverised chalk or limestone ) were poured on the soil to reduce acidity. The effort went on for decades; by the late 1990s, between 14 million and 16 million tonnes of lime were being spread on Brazilian fields each year. The quantity rose to 25 million tonnes in 2003 and 2004, equalling around five tonnes of lime per hectare. As a result, Brazil has become the world's second biggest soybean exporter. Soybeans are also widely used in animal feed, and the large volume of soy produced in Brazil has contributed to Brazil's rise to become the biggest exporter of beef and poultry in the world. [52] Several parallels can also be found in Argentina's boom in soybean production as well. [53]\nThere have been numerous attempts to introduce the successful concepts from the Mexican and Indian projects into Africa. [54] These programs have generally been less successful. Reasons cited include widespread corruption, insecurity, a lack of infrastructure, and a general lack of will on the part of the governments. Yet environmental factors, such as the availability of water for irrigation, the high diversity in slope and soil types in one given area are also reasons why the Green Revolution is not so successful in Africa. [55]\nA recent program in western Africa is attempting to introduce a new high-yielding 'family' of rice varieties known as \" New Rice for Africa \" (NERICA). NERICA varieties yield about 30% more rice under normal conditions, and can double yields with small amounts of fertilizer and very basic irrigation. However, the program has been beset by problems getting the rice into the hands of farmers, and to date the only success has been in Guinea , where it currently accounts for 16% of rice cultivation. [56]\nAfter a famine in 2001 and years of chronic hunger and poverty, in 2005 the small African country of Malawi launched the \"Agricultural Input Subsidy Program\" by which vouchers are given to smallholder farmers to buy subsidized nitrogen fertilizer and maize seeds. [57] Within its first year, the program was reported to have had extreme success, producing the largest maize harvest of the country's history, enough to feed the country with tons of maize left over. The program has advanced yearly ever since. Various sources claim that the program has been an unusual success, hailing it as a \"miracle\". [58] Malawi experienced a 40% drop in maize production in 2015 and 2016. [59]\nA 2021 randomized control trial on temporary subsidies for maize farmers in Mozambique found that adoption of Green Revolution technology led to increased maize yields in both the short- and long-term. [60]\nMain article: CGIAR\nIn 1970, foundation officials proposed a worldwide network of agricultural research centers under a permanent secretariat. This was further supported and developed by the World Bank ; on 19 May 1971, the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) was established, co-sponsored by the FAO , IFAD , and UNDP . CGIAR has added many research centers throughout the world.\nCGIAR has responded, at least in part, to criticisms of Green Revolution methodologies. This began in the 1980s, and mainly was a result of pressure from donor organizations. [61] Methods like agroecosystem analysis and farming system research have been adopted to gain a more holistic view of agriculture.\nAccording to a 2012 review in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the existing academic literature, the Green Revolution \"contributed to widespread poverty reduction, averted hunger for millions of people, and avoided the conversion of thousands of hectares of land into agricultural cultivation.\" [12]\nThe Green Revolution spread technologies that already existed, but had not been widely implemented outside industrialized nations. Two kinds of technologies were used in the Green Revolution and aim at cultivation and breeding area respectively. The technologies in cultivation are targeted at providing excellent growing conditions, which included modern irrigation projects, pesticides , and synthetic nitrogen fertilizer . The breeding technologies aimed at improving crop varieties developed through the conventional, science-based methods available at the time. These technologies included hybrids , combining modern genetics with selections. [62]\nThe novel technological development of the Green Revolution was the production of novel wheat cultivars . Agronomists bred cultivars of maize, wheat, and rice that are the generally referred to as HYVs or \" high-yielding varieties \". HYVs have higher nitrogen-absorbing potential than other varieties. Since cereals that absorbed extra nitrogen would typically lodge, or fall over before harvest, semi-dwarfing genes were bred into their genomes . A Japanese dwarf wheat cultivar Norin 10 developed by Japanese agronomist Gonjiro Inazuka , which was sent to Orville Vogel at Washington State University by Cecil Salmon , was instrumental in developing Green Revolution wheat cultivars. IR8, the first widely implemented HYV rice to be developed by IRRI, was created through a cross between an Indonesian variety named \"Peta\" and a Chinese variety named \"Dee-geo-woo-gen\" [ citation needed ] In the 1960s, when a food crisis happened in Asia, the spread of HYV rice was aggravated intensely. [63]\nDr. Norman Borlaug , who is usually recognized as the \"Father of the Green Revolution\", bred rust-resistant cultivars which have strong and firm stems, preventing them from falling over under extreme weather at high levels of fertilization. CIMMYT (Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de Maiz y Trigo – International Center for Maize and Wheat Improvements) conducted these breeding programs and helped spread high-yielding varieties in Mexico and countries in Asia like India and Pakistan . These programs successfully led the harvest double in these countries. [62]\nPlant scientists figured out several parameters related to the high yield and identified the related genes which control the plant height and tiller number. [64] With advances in molecular genetics , the mutant genes responsible for Arabidopsis thaliana genes (GA 20-oxidase, [65] ga1 , [66] ga1-3 [67] ), wheat reduced-height genes ( Rht ) [68] and a rice semidwarf gene ( sd1 ) [69] were cloned . These were identified as gibberellin biosynthesis genes or cellular signaling component genes. Stem growth in the mutant background is significantly reduced leading to the dwarf phenotype . Photosynthetic investment in the stem is reduced dramatically as the shorter plants are inherently more stable mechanically. Assimilates become redirected to grain production, amplifying in particular the effect of chemical fertilizers on commercial yield. [ citation needed ]\nHYVs significantly outperform traditional varieties in the presence of adequate irrigation, pesticides, and fertilizers. In the absence of these inputs, traditional varieties may outperform HYVs. Therefore, several authors have challenged the apparent superiority of HYVs not only compared to the traditional varieties alone, but by contrasting the monocultural system associated with HYVs with the polycultural system associated with traditional ones. [70]\nBy one 2021 estimate, the Green Revolution increased yields by 44% between 1965 and 2010. [13] Cereal production more than doubled in developing nations between the years 1961–1985. [71] Yields of rice, maize, and wheat increased steadily during that period. [71] The production increases can be attributed roughly equally to irrigation, fertilizer, and seed development, at least in the case of Asian rice. [71]\nWhile agricultural output increased as a result of the Green Revolution, the energy input to produce a crop has increased faster, [72] so that the ratio of crops produced to energy input has decreased over time. Green Revolution techniques also heavily rely on agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers , pesticides , herbicides , and defoliants ; which, as of 2014, rely on or are derived from crude oil , making agriculture increasingly reliant on crude oil extraction. [73] Proponents of the Peak Oil theory fear that a future decline in oil and gas production would lead to a decline in food production or even a Malthusian catastrophe . [74]\nMain article: Food security\nThe energy for the Green Revolution was provided by fossil fuels in the form of fertilizers (natural gas), pesticides (oil), and hydrocarbon fueled irrigation . [75] [76] The development of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer has significantly supported global population growth — it has been estimated that almost half the people on the Earth are currently fed as a result of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer use. [77] According to ICIS Fertilizers managing editor Julia Meehan, \"People don’t realise that 50% of the world’s food relies on fertilisers.\" [78]\nThe world population has grown by about five billion [79] since the beginning of the Green Revolution and many believe that, without the Revolution, there would have been greater famine and malnutrition . India saw annual wheat production rise from 10 million tons in the 1960s to 73 million in 2006. [80] The average person in the developing world consumes roughly 25% more calories per day now than before the Green Revolution. [71] Between 1950 and 1984, as the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the globe, world grain production increased by about 160%. [81]\nThe production increases fostered by the Green Revolution are often credited with having helped to avoid widespread famine , and for feeding billions of people. [82]\nThere are also claims that the Green Revolution has decreased food security for a large number of people. One claim involves the shift of subsistence-oriented cropland to cropland oriented towards production of grain for export or animal feed. For example, the Green Revolution replaced much of the land used for pulses that fed Indian peasants for wheat, which did not make up a large portion of the peasant diet. [83]\nSome criticisms generally involve some variation of the Malthusian principle of population. Such concerns often revolve around the idea that the Green Revolution is unsustainable, [85] and argue that humanity is now in a state of overpopulation or overshoot with regards to the sustainable carrying capacity and ecological demands on the Earth. A 2021 study found, contrary to the expectations of the Malthusian hypothesis, that the Green Revolution led to reduced population growth, rather than an increase in population growth. [13]\nAlthough 36 million people die each year as a direct or indirect result of hunger and poor nutrition, [86] [ circular reference ] Malthus's more extreme predictions have frequently failed to materialize. In 1798 Thomas Malthus made his prediction of impending famine. [87] The world's population had doubled by 1923 and doubled again by 1973 without fulfilling Malthus's prediction. Malthusian Paul R. Ehrlich , in his 1968 book The Population Bomb , said that \"India couldn't possibly feed two hundred million more people by 1980\" and \"Hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs.\" [87] Ehrlich's warnings failed to materialize when India became self-sustaining in cereal production in 1974 (six years later) as a result of the introduction of Norman Borlaug 's dwarf wheat varieties. [87]\nHowever, Borlaug was well aware of the implications of population growth. In his Nobel lecture he repeatedly presented improvements in food production within a sober understanding of the context of population. \"The green revolution has won a temporary success in man's war against hunger and deprivation; it has given man a breathing space. If fully implemented, the revolution can provide sufficient food for sustenance during the next three decades. But the frightening power of human reproduction must also be curbed; otherwise the success of the green revolution will be ephemeral only. Most people still fail to comprehend the magnitude and menace of the \"Population Monster\"...Since man is potentially a rational being, however, I am confident that within the next two decades he will recognize the self-destructive course he steers along the road of irresponsible population growth...\"\nTo some modern Western sociologists and writers, increasing food production is not synonymous with increasing food security , and is only part of a larger equation. For example, Harvard professor Amartya Sen wrote that large historic famines were not caused by decreases in food supply, but by socioeconomic dynamics and a failure of public action. [89] Economist Peter Bowbrick disputes Sen's theory, arguing that Sen relies on inconsistent arguments and contradicts available information, including sources that Sen himself cited. [90] Bowbrick further argues that Sen's views coincide with that of the Bengal government at the time of the Bengal famine of 1943 , and the policies Sen advocates failed to relieve the famine. [90]\nSome have challenged the value of the increased food production of Green Revolution agriculture. Miguel A. Altieri , (a pioneer of agroecology and peasant-advocate), writes that the comparison between traditional systems of agriculture and Green Revolution agriculture has been unfair, because Green Revolution agriculture produces monocultures of cereal grains, while traditional agriculture usually incorporates polycultures . [ citation needed ]\nThese monoculture crops are often used for export, feed for animals, or conversion into biofuel. According to Emile Frison of Bioversity International , the Green Revolution has also led to a change in dietary habits, as fewer people are affected by hunger and die from starvation, but many are affected by malnutrition such as iron or vitamin-A deficiencies . [55] Frison further asserts that almost 60% of yearly deaths of children under age five in developing countries are related to malnutrition. [55]\nThe strategies developed by the Green Revolution focused on fending off starvation and was very successful in raising overall yields of cereal grains, but did not give sufficient relevance to nutritional quality. [91] High yield-cereal crops have low quality proteins , with essential amino acid deficiencies, are high in carbohydrates , and lack balanced essential fatty acids , vitamins , minerals and other quality factors. [91]\nHigh-yield rice (HYR), introduced since 1964 to poverty-ridden Asian countries, such as the Philippines , was found to have inferior flavor and be more glutinous and less savory than their native varieties. [ citation needed ] This caused its price to be lower than the average market value. [92]\nIn the Philippines the introduction of heavy pesticides to rice production, in the early part of the Green Revolution, poisoned and killed off fish and weedy green vegetables that traditionally coexisted in rice paddies . These were nutritious food sources for many poor Filipino farmers prior to the introduction of pesticides, further impacting the diets of locals. [93]\nA critic [94] of the Green Revolution, American journalist Mark Dowie argues that \"the primary objective of the program was geopolitical: to provide food for the populace in undeveloped countries and so bring social stability and weaken the fomenting of communist insurgency.\" [95] Citing internal Foundation documents, Dowie states that the Ford Foundation had a greater concern than Rockefeller in this area. [96]\nThe transition from traditional agriculture (in which inputs were generated on-farm) to Green Revolution agriculture (which required the purchase of inputs) led to the widespread establishment of rural credit institutions. Smaller farmers often went into debt , which in many cases resulted in a loss of their farmland. [61] [97] The increased level of mechanization on larger farms made possible by the Green Revolution removed a large source of employment from the rural economy. [61]\nThe new economic difficulties of smallholder farmers and landless farm workers led to increased rural-urban migration . The increase in food production led to cheaper food for urban dwellers. [ citation needed ]\nAccording to a 2021 study, the Green Revolution substantially increased income. [13] A delay in the Green Revolution by ten years would have cost 17% of GDP per capita, whereas if the Green Revolution had never happened, it could have reduced GDP per capita in the developing world by half. [13]\nThe spread of Green Revolution agriculture affected both agricultural biodiversity (or agrodiversity) and wild biodiversity. [93] There is little disagreement that the Green Revolution acted to reduce agricultural biodiversity, as it relied on just a few high-yield varieties of each crop.\nThis has led to concerns about the susceptibility of a food supply to pathogens that cannot be controlled by agrochemicals, as well as the permanent loss of many valuable genetic traits bred into traditional varieties over thousands of years. To address these concerns, massive seed banks such as Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research ’s (CGIAR) International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (now Bioversity International ) have been established (see Svalbard Global Seed Vault ).\nThere are varying opinions about the effect of the Green Revolution on wild biodiversity. One hypothesis speculates that by increasing production per unit of land area, agriculture will not need to expand into new, uncultivated areas to feed a growing human population. [98] However, land degradation and soil nutrients depletion have forced farmers to clear forested areas in order to maintain production. [99] A counter-hypothesis speculates that biodiversity was sacrificed because traditional systems of agriculture that were displaced sometimes incorporated practices to preserve wild biodiversity, and because the Green Revolution expanded agricultural development into new areas where it was once unprofitable or too arid . For example, the development of wheat varieties tolerant to acid soil conditions with high aluminium content permitted the introduction of agriculture in sensitive Brazilian ecosystems such as Cerrado semi-humid tropical savanna and Amazon rainforest in the geoeconomic macroregions of Centro-Sul and Amazônia . [98] Before the Green Revolution, other Brazilian ecosystems were also significantly damaged by human activity, such as the once 1st or 2nd main contributor to Brazilian megadiversity Atlantic Rainforest (above 85% of deforestation in the 1980s, about 95% after the 2010s) and the important xeric shrublands called Caatinga mainly in Northeastern Brazil (about 40% in the 1980s, about 50% after the 2010s – deforestation of the Caatinga biome is generally associated with greater risks of desertification ). This also caused many animal species to suffer due to their damaged habitats.\nNevertheless, the world community has clearly acknowledged the negative aspects of agricultural expansion as the 1992 Rio Treaty , signed by 189 nations, has generated numerous national Biodiversity Action Plans which assign significant biodiversity loss to agriculture's expansion into new domains.\nThe Green Revolution has been criticized for an agricultural model which relied on a few staple and market profitable crops, and pursuing a model which limited the biodiversity of Mexico. One of the critics against these techniques and the Green Revolution as a whole was Carl O. Sauer , a geography professor at the University of California, Berkeley . According to Sauer these techniques of plant breeding would result in negative effects on the country's resources, and the culture:\n\"A good aggressive bunch of American agronomists and plant breeders could ruin the native resources for good and all by pushing their American commercial stocks... And Mexican agriculture cannot be pointed toward standardization on a few commercial types without upsetting native economy and culture hopelessly... Unless the Americans understand that, they'd better keep out of this country entirely. That must be approached from an appreciation of native economies as being basically sound\". [100]\nStudies indicate that the Green Revolution has substantially reduced emissions of the greenhouse gas CO 2 . [101] According to a study published in 2013 in PNAS , in the absence of the crop germplasm improvement associated with the Green Revolution, greenhouse gas emissions would have been 5.2–7.4 Gt higher than observed in 1965–2004. [16] High yield agriculture has dramatic effects on the amount of carbon cycling in the atmosphere. The way in which farms are grown, in tandem with the seasonal carbon cycling of various crops, could alter the impact carbon in the atmosphere has on global warming. Wheat, rice, and soybean crops account for a significant amount of the increase in carbon in the atmosphere over the last 50 years. [102]\nPoorly regulated applications of nitrogen fertilizer that exceed the amount used by plants, such as broadcast applications of urea , results in emissions of nitrous oxide , a potent greenhouse gas, and in water pollution. [103]\nMost high intensity agricultural production is highly reliant on agricultural machinery and transport, as well as the production of pesticides and nitrates that all require energy. [104] Nitrogen fertilizer is a direct fossil fuel product processed primarily from natural gas . It is estimated that no more than 3.7 billion people of the current world population could be fed without this single fossil fuel agricultural input. [105] Moreover, the essential mineral nutrient phosphorus is often a limiting factor in crop cultivation, while phosphorus mines are rapidly being depleted worldwide. [106]\nA 2021 study found that the Green Revolution led to a reduction in land used for agriculture. [13]\nStudies have found that the Green Revolution substantially reduced infant mortality in the developing world. A 2020 study of 37 developing countries found that the diffusion of modern crop varieties \"reduced infant mortality by 2.4–5.3 percentage points (from a baseline of 18%), with stronger effects for male infants and among poor households.\" [14] Another 2020 study found that high yield crop varieties reduced infant mortality in India, with particularly large effects for rural children, boys and low-caste children. [15]\nConsumption of pesticides and fertilizer agrochemicals associated with the Green Revolution may have adverse health impacts. For example, pesticides may increase the likelihood of cancer. [107] Poor farming practices including non-compliance to usage of masks and over-usage of the chemicals compound this situation. [107] In 1989, WHO and UNEP estimated that there were around 1 million human pesticide poisonings annually. Some 20,000 (mostly in developing countries) ended in death, as a result of poor labeling, loose safety standards etc. [108] A 2014 study found that Indian children who were exposed to higher quantities of fertilizer agrochemicals experienced more adverse health impacts. [109]\nA Greenpeace Research Laboratories investigation of 50 villages in Muktsar , Bathinda and Ludhiana districts revealed that twenty percent of the sampled wells had nitrate levels above WHO limits for drinking water. The 2009 study linked the nitrate pollution with high use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers . [110]\nBorlaug dismissed certain claims of critics, but also cautioned, \"There are no miracles in agricultural production. Nor is there such a thing as a miracle variety of wheat, rice, or maize which can serve as an elixir to cure all ills of a stagnant, traditional agriculture.\" [111]\nOf environmental lobbyists, he said, \"some of the environmental lobbyists of the Western nations are the salt of the earth , but many of them are elitists . They've never experienced the physical sensation of hunger. They do their lobbying from comfortable office suites in Washington or Brussels . If they lived just one month amid the misery of the developing world, as I have for fifty years, they'd be crying out for tractors and fertilizer and irrigation canals and be outraged that fashionable elitists back home were trying to deny them these things.\" [112]\nAlthough the Green Revolution has been able to improve agricultural output in some regions in the world, there was and is still room for improvement. As a result, many organizations continue to invent new ways to improve the techniques already used in the Green Revolution. Frequently quoted inventions are the System of Rice Intensification , [113] marker-assisted selection , [114] agroecology , [115] and applying existing technologies to agricultural problems of the developing world. [116] Current challenges for nations trying to modernize their agriculture include closing the urban-rural income gap, integration of smallholders into value chains, and maintaining competitiveness in the market. [117] However, in low-income countries, chronic problems such as poverty and hunger cause agricultural modernization efforts to be constrained. [118] It is projected that global populations by 2050 will increase by one-third and as such will require a 70% increase in the production of food. [119] Therefore, the Second Green Revolution will likely focus on improving tolerances to pests and disease in addition to technological input use efficiency.\nThe term 'Evergreen Revolution' [a] was coined by Indian agricultural scientist M. S. Swaminathan in 1990, though he has stated that the concept dates back to as early as 1968. It aims to represent an added dimension to the original concepts and practices of the green revolution, the ecological dimension. [120] [121] Swaminathan has described it as \"productivity in perpetuity without associated ecological harm\". [120] The concept has evolved into a combination of science, economics, and sociology. [122] [123] In 2002, American biologist E.O. Wilson observed that: [120] [ emphasis added ]\nThe problem before us is how to feed billions of new mouths over the next several decades and save the rest of life at the same time, without being trapped in a Faustian bargain that threatens freedom and security. No one knows the exact solution to this dilemma. The benefit must come from an Evergreen Revolution . The aim of this new thrust is to lift food production well above the level obtained by the Green Revolution of the 1960s, using technology and regulatory policy more advanced and even safer than those now in existence.— E.O.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "The federal Lanham Act and the FTC Act both prohibit unfair or deceptive advertising.", "reference_documents": ["All businesses that have a product or service to sell must advertise, and a competitive marketplace can lead to a range of dubious methods. Most of the time, businesses might exaggerate some aspect of their products and services, like calling them “The Best _______ in the World,” but some advertisements cross a line into unlawful territory. Claims that are outright misleading or false, especially those that could harm consumers or other businesses, are often prohibited by state and federal consumer protection laws .\nA common form of false advertising involves deceptive or misleading product descriptions, particularly claims that a product has certain features or benefits that it does not, or that it is of a higher quality than it actually is. Examples include:\n- Use of misleading terms, such as “organic,” “natural,” or “light”;\n- False claims of scientific support, or endorsement by scientific or medical authorities;\n- Misleading illustrations or photographs;\n- Use of coloring or other modifications to make a product appear to be of a different quality; or\n- Falsely claiming that a product contains certain ingredients, or misrepresenting the quantity of an ingredient.\nIn 2010, for example, Dannon was ordered to pay about $45 million in damages to plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit alleging false claims about two yogurt products, Activia and DanActive. Advertisements for the products claimed the products had “clinically proven” health benefits. The company charged more for the products, and consumers were induced to purchase the products, based on these claims. In addition to monetary damages, the court ordered Dannon to modify its advertising.\nAnother common false advertising scheme involves hidden fees or surcharges, which can cause the final price paid by a consumer to be substantially higher than the advertised price. This might occur with telecommunications companies, when the service provider hides additional, unauthorized charges on consumers’ bills. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) calls this practice “cramming.” Airlines also have been the subject of complaints about hidden fees charged to passengers.\n“Going out of business” sales might involve deceptive pricing practices, such as when a liquidator inflates prices while claiming that they have been marked down.\nThe type of product or service advertised may implicate certain other laws and regulations. For example, alcohol and tobacco products often have their own, stricter set of advertising rules.\nAdvertisers might mislead consumers by using a different standard of measurement, making a product seem larger or smaller than it actually is. Food products might include packing material to make them appear larger, or filler to increase the weight.\nIn one instance of this behavior, computer hard drive manufacturer Western Digital settled a class action lawsuit in 2006 involving claims about hard drive capacity. In computer science, one kilobyte (KB) equals 1,024 bytes of memory, based on the binary numeral system used by computers. One megabyte (MB) would be equal to the square of one KB, or 1,048,576 bytes. The class action lawsuit alleged that Western Digital and other manufacturers used the decimal system, in which one KB equals 1,000 bytes and one MB equals one million bytes. The company’s 80-gigabyte (GB) hard drive, using the binary system, allegedly held only 74.4 GB of data.\nComparing one’s product to a competitor’s product is inherently tricky, and advertisers may deceive consumers by focusing on attributes where their product exceeds their competitor’s, while ignoring other attributes. Advertisers might use comparative words with vague or ambiguous meaning, such as “stronger” or “better,” without placing the comparison in the proper context.\nThis type of advertising can result in disputes between businesses, such as the lawsuit filed by Pizza Hut against its competitor Papa John’s in 1997 over the slogan “Better Ingredients. Better Pizza.” The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the slogan was “not an objectifiable statement of fact” that consumers might rely upon and dismissed the lawsuit. Pizza Hut v. Papa John’s Int’l , 227 F.3d 489, 491 (5th Cir. 2000).\nBusinesses may offer a guarantee or warranty for their services that does not specify a remedy and then decline to provide any relief to consumers. Contract law typically requires certainty in terms for a contract to be enforceable, so laws regulating deceptive and false advertising must fill in the gap.\nThe federal Lanham Act allows civil lawsuits for false advertising that “misrepresents the nature, characteristics, qualities, or geographic origin” of goods or services. 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a) . The FTC also enforces false advertising laws on behalf of consumers.\nStates have their own laws regulating false advertising and other deceptive trade practices. California, for example, prohibits dissemination of information about products or services that is “untrue or misleading,” with both civil and criminal enforcement. CA Bus. & Prof. Code § 17500 .\nIn addition to enforcement by the FTC and state agencies, parties affected by false advertising, such as consumers and competitors, may bring private lawsuits."], "label": "AMBIG", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": {"original_label": "NS"}}
{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "For example, the average weight for a man in his 20s is around 189 pounds.", "reference_documents": ["With obesity on the rise worldwide and in the United States, the average American man is overweight. While the average weight for men varies depending on height and geographic location, it's important to note that average and healthy weight are not the same.\nMen (and women) who carry excess weight are at a greater risk for health problems, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and arthritis . 1 Find out how the average male weight by height compares to other averages over the years and what you can do to maintain a healthy weight.\nThe average man in the U.S. over the age of 20 weighs 199.8 pounds (90.62kg). Note that weight tends to increase with age, with older men weighing about 200 pounds (90.72kg). However, after age 70, weight tends to decrease with age, with the average man weighing about 193.4 pounds (87.72kg). 2\nAlmost three out of every four men in the U.S. is considered to be either overweight or obese. 3 However, the number on the scale can often be misleading. If you suspect you might be overweight, rather than comparing your weight with the average weight of other men your age, calculate your body mass index (BMI) instead.\nBMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a BMI between 25 and 29.9 signifies overweight, and a BMI of 30 or more signifies obesity. 4 This BMI calculator can provide you with an estimate.\nKeep in mind that BMI is only one way to assess weight and doesn’t account for body composition (amount of fat and muscle). Two men could have the same BMI, but for one man, the number may represent an acceptable weight, while for the other, it may represent a risky one.\nLooking at average weights can be deceptive. A man's height, the measurement of his middle, his genetics, and even his ethnicity all play a part in his overall health regardless of what he weighs.\nThe following table compares the average weight and BMI for American men in different age groups based on an average height of about 69 inches, which is 5'9\" (175.3cm). 3 Note that the average BMI scores are above 25, which is considered overweight. In addition, an ideal weight for a man this height is about 152 pounds with a BMI of 22. 5\n|Average Weight for Adult Men in the U.S. (2015–2018)|\n|Age group||Average weight|\n|20–29||188.6lb (85.54kg)|\n|30–39||208.1lb (94.39kg)|\n|40-49||206.9lb (93.85kg)|\n|50-59||202.5lb (91.85kg)|\n|60-69||201.2lb (91.26kg)|\n|70-79||193.4lb (87.72kg)|\n|80 and over||177.5lb (80.51kg)|\nIf you need to lose weight, see your doctor. They can help you come up with a safe, manageable plan for weight loss.\nBMI, weight, height, and head circumference measurements have been collected in the U.S. since the mid-1950s. They've revealed, not surprisingly, that men have been getting taller —and heavier—over the decades.\nA report published in 1959 showed the average weight of male adults (those ages 20 and over) in the U.S. ranged from 151 pounds for a man 5 feet, 4 inches tall to 186 pounds for a 6-foot, 1-inch tall man. At those weights, the BMI of the shorter man would be about 26, and the BMI of the taller man would be 24.5. By today's standards, the shorter man would be considered overweight, and the taller man would be on the higher side of what's regarded as a normal weight. 3\nRegarding height and weight trends, the average height of a man in the U.S. increased by just 1 inch in the 42 years between 1960 and 2002. However, during that same period, the average weight of an American male jumped from around 166 pounds to 191 pounds. 6\nThe biggest increases were found in older men: 6\n- Men between the ages of 40 and 49 saw an average weight increase of 27 pounds.\n- Men between the ages of 50 and 59 logged an increase of 28 pounds.\n- Men 60 and older saw an increase of 33 pounds.\nLooking at the average weights for men can provide some general guidelines for what other people tend to weigh, but these numbers aren't meant to indicate a healthy weight for each individual.\nMaintaining a healthy weight includes a reduced risk for obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and other forms of chronic illness. Managing your weight can also help you to live longer. 7 Try these strategies to reach a weight that is healthy for you.\n- Have realistic weight goals : Diets that promise quick weight loss rarely work in the long term. Most experts agree that a healthy and steady rate of weight loss is 1 to 2 pounds per week. Set realistic and sustainable weight loss goals for yourself to promote weight management.\n- Eat a healthy diet : Nutrition that includes a balanced mix of protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats from nutrient-dense whole foods is key to managing your weight and maintaining overall health.\n- Stay active : While eating healthy is essential, regular exercise that includes at least 150 minutes of heart-pumping physical activity and two sessions of strength training per week 8 can promote weight loss and weight management. Regular exercise can also reduce the risk of obesity, heart disease, cancer, and other chronic health conditions. 9\n- Get enough rest : Research shows that not getting enough sleep can lead to hormonal imbalances , making it more difficult to lose weight and increasing the risk of obesity. 10 Getting enough sleep will also help to ensure you have enough energy to exercise. In addition, you'll be more likely to make healthy food choices when you're well-rested.\nFrom a broad perspective, these types of statistics can offer up an idea of the general health of the male population. They can help you to see where you fall within the statistics, which can be a powerful incentive to lose weight or exercise more if it's clear you're on the higher end of the range for your height and age. Of course, you'll want to get your doctor's perspective as well.\n- What is the average weight for an 18-year-old man?\nAccording to the National Health and Statistics, the average weight for an 18-year-old male is 166.7 pounds. 2 That amount has gradually increased over the years, up from 128 pounds in the 1970s. 6\n- How do you calculate the average body weight for men?\nThe ideal average body weight for men is usually calculated in kilograms: 52 kg + 1.9 kg for each inch over 5 feet. Therefore, the average weight for a man who is 5 feet, 10 inches tall is 71 kilograms or 156.5 pounds. However, the ideal average body weight varies based on body mass index (BMI) and other factors such as age, muscle tone, athleticism, and body frame size.\n- What is the average height of a man in the U.S.?\nThe average height of a man in the United States is 5'9\", which is 69 inches, or 175.3 centimeters.\n- How reliable is BMI as a measurement?\nBMI is not very reliable for individual use. It is meant as a general population statistic. The heavier you are, the more accurate it may be when categorizing overweight and obesity. However, for young people, muscular people, and older individuals, BMI is not accurate. Muscular people are often determined to be overweight when their body composition and weight is very healthy."], "label": "AMBIG", "category": "ClaimVerify", "additional_info": {"original_label": "NS"}}

Most cases are idiopathic; however, a similar appearance may occur in Chagas disease. Authors differ as to whether to reserve the term achalasia for idiopathic cases or to include Chagas disease. Patients with Allgrove syndrome (triple A syndrome) also have achalasia which is very similar to the primary form of the disease.\n\nClinical presentation\n\nPatients typically present with:\n\ndysphagia for both solids and liquids: this is in contradistinction to dysphagia for solids only in cases of esophageal carcinoma 7\n\nchest pain/discomfort\n\neventual regurgitation\n\nSymptoms are initially intermittent. Patients may also present with complications of long-standing achalasia:\n\nesophageal carcinoma the most dreaded complication, seen in ~5%, most often in the mid-esophagus thought to occur because of chronic irritation of the mucosa by stasis of food and secretions\n\naspiration pneumonia: the chronic presence of fluid debris in the esophagus makes patients very prone to aspiration\n\ncandida esophagitis\n\nacute airway obstruction: this is a rare complication requiring immediate esophageal decompression with a nasogastric tube\n\nThe Eckhardt score can be used to grade the clinical severity of achalasia.\n\nPathology\n\nThe lower esophageal sphincter fails to relax, either partially or completely, with elevated pressures demonstrated manometrically 4. This appears to be due to loss/destruction of neurons in the Auerbach/myenteric plexus. Early in the course of achalasia, the lower esophageal sphincter tone may be normal or changes may be subtle.\n\nPeristalsis in the distal smooth muscle segment of the esophagus is eventually lost due to a combination of damage to the Auerbach plexus and vagus nerve (possibly partly due to damage at the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve).\n\nClassification\n\nIt may be divided into three distinct types based on manometric patterns:\n\ntype I: (classic) with minimal contractility in the esophageal body\n\ntype II: with intermittent periods of pan-esophageal pressurisation\n\ntype III: (spastic) with premature or spastic distal esophageal contractions\n\nRadiographic features\n\nAchalasia characteristically involves a short segment (less than 3.5 cm in length) of the distal esophagus.\n\nPlain radiograph\n\nChest radiograph findings include:\n\nconvex opacity overlapping the right mediastinum. Occasionally may present as a left convex opacity if the thoracic aorta is tortuous.\n\nair-fluid level due to stasis in a thoracic esophagus filled with retained secretions and food\n\nsmall or absent gastric bubble\n\nanterior displacement and bowing of the trachea on the lateral view\n\npatchy alveolar opacities, usually bilateral, may be seen. These represent acute pneumonitis or chronic aspiration pneumonia related to dysphagia.\n\nFluoroscopy\n\nBarium swallow\n\nA barium swallow study may be used to confirm esophageal dilatation, in addition to assessing for mucosal abnormalities.\n\nFindings include:\n\nbird beak sign or rat tail sign\n\nesophageal dilatation\n\ntram track appearance: central longitudinal lucency bounded by barium on both sides 8\n\nincomplete lower esophageal sphincter relaxation that is not coordinated with esophageal contraction\n\npooling or stasis of barium in the esophagus when the esophagus has become atonic or non-contractile (a late feature in the disease)\n\nuncoordinated, non-propulsive, tertiary contractions\n\nfailure of normal peristalsis to clear the esophagus of barium when the patient is in the recumbent position, with no primary waves identified\n\nwhen the barium column is high enough (with the patient standing), the hydrostatic pressure can overcome the lower esophageal sphincter pressure, allowing passage of esophageal content\n\na hot or carbonated drink during the exam may help visualize sphincter relaxation and barium emptying\n\nUltrasound\n\nSmooth narrowing at oesophago-gastric junction and proximal dilated esophagus can be seen. It can also be useful to rule out possibility of any malignant mass in the region.\n\nCT\n\nPatients with uncomplicated achalasia demonstrate a dilated, thin-walled esophagus filled with fluid/food debris.\n\nOverall, CT has little role in directly assessing patients with achalasia, but is useful in assessing common complications. Careful assessment of the wall of the esophagus should be undertaken to identify any focal regions of thickening which may indicate malignancy. The lungs should be inspected for evidence of aspiration.\n\nTreatment and prognosis\n\nTreatment is aimed at allowing adequate drainage of the esophagus into the stomach.

For other uses, see Contraception (disambiguation)\n\nBirth control, also known as contraception, anticonception, and fertility control, is the use of methods or devices to prevent unintended pregnancy.[1] Birth control has been used since ancient times, but effective and safe methods of birth control only became available in the 20th century.[2] Planning, making available, and using human birth control is called family planning.[3][4] Some cultures limit or discourage access to birth control because they consider it to be morally, religiously, or politically undesirable.[2]\n\nThe World Health Organization and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provide guidance on the safety of birth control methods among women with specific medical conditions.[5][6] The most effective methods of birth control are sterilization by means of vasectomy in males and tubal ligation in females, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and implantable birth control.[7] This is followed by a number of hormone-based methods including oral pills, patches, vaginal rings, and injections.[7] Less effective methods include physical barriers such as condoms, diaphragms and birth control sponges and fertility awareness methods.[7] The least effective methods are spermicides and withdrawal by the male before ejaculation.[7] Sterilization, while highly effective, is not usually reversible; all other methods are reversible, most immediately upon stopping them.[7] Safe sex practices, such as with the use of male or female condoms, can also help prevent sexually transmitted infections.[8] Other methods of birth control do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases.[9] Emergency birth control can prevent pregnancy if taken within 72 to 120 hours after unprotected sex.[10][11] Some argue not having sex is also a form of birth control, but abstinence-only sex education may increase teenage pregnancies if offered without birth control education, due to non-compliance.[12][13]\n\nIn teenagers, pregnancies are at greater risk of poor outcomes.[14] Comprehensive sex education and access to birth control decreases the rate of unintended pregnancies in this age group.[14][15] While all forms of birth control can generally be used by young people,[16] long-acting reversible birth control such as implants, IUDs, or vaginal rings are more successful in reducing rates of teenage pregnancy.[15] After the delivery of a child, a woman who is not exclusively breastfeeding may become pregnant again after as few as four to six weeks.[16] Some methods of birth control can be started immediately following the birth, while others require a delay of up to six months.[16] In women who are breastfeeding, progestin-only methods are preferred over combined oral birth control pills.[16] In women who have reached menopause, it is recommended that birth control be continued for one year after the last menstrual period.[16]\n\nAbout 222 million women who want to avoid pregnancy in developing countries are not using a modern birth control method.[17][18] Birth control use in developing countries has decreased the number of deaths during or around the time of pregnancy by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% if the full demand for birth control were met.[19][20] By lengthening the time between pregnancies, birth control can improve adult women's delivery outcomes and the survival of their children.[19] In the developing world, women's earnings, assets, and weight, as well as their children's schooling and health, all improve with greater access to birth control.[21] Birth control increases economic growth because of fewer dependent children, more women participating in the workforce, and less use of scarce resources.[21][22]\n\nVideo explaining how to prevent unwanted pregnancy\n\nMethods [ edit ]\n\nChance of pregnancy during first year of use[23][24] Method Typical use Perfect use No birth control 85% 85% Combination pill 9% 0.3% Progestin-only pill 13% 1.1% Sterilization (female) 0.5% 0.5% Sterilization (male) 0.15% 0.1% Condom (female) 21% 5% Condom (male) 18% 2% Copper IUD 0.8% 0.6% Hormonal IUD 0.2% 0.2% Patch 9% 0.3% Vaginal ring 9% 0.3% MPA shot 6% 0.2% Implant 0.05% 0.05% Diaphragm and spermicide 12% 6% Fertility awareness 24% 0.4–5% Withdrawal 22% 4% Lactational amenorrhea method\n\n(6 months failure rate) 0–7.5%[25] <2%[26]\n\nBirth control methods include barrier methods, hormonal birth control, intrauterine devices (IUDs), sterilization, and behavioral methods. They are used before or during sex while emergency contraceptives are effective for up to five days after sex. Effectiveness is generally expressed as the percentage of women who become pregnant using a given method during the first year,[27] and sometimes as a lifetime failure rate among methods with high effectiveness, such as tubal ligation.[28]\n\nThe most effective methods are those that are long acting and do not require ongoing health care visits.[29] Surgical sterilization, implantable hormones, and intrauterine devices all have first-year failure rates of less than 1%.[23] Hormonal contraceptive pills, patches or vaginal rings, and the lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), if adhered to strictly, can also have first-year (or for LAM, first-6-month) failure rates of less than 1%.[29] With typical use, first-year failure rates are considerably higher, at 9%, due to inconsistent use.[23] Other methods such as condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides have higher first-year failure rates even with perfect usage.[29] The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends long acting reversible birth control as first line for young individuals.[30]\n\nWhile all methods of birth control have some potential adverse effects, the risk is less than that of pregnancy.[29] After stopping or removing many methods of birth control, including oral contraceptives, IUDs, implants and injections, the rate of pregnancy during the subsequent year is the same as for those who used no birth control.[31]\n\nFor individuals with specific health problems, certain forms of birth control may require further investigations.[32] For women who are otherwise healthy, many methods of birth control should not require a medical exam—including birth control pills, injectable or implantable birth control, and condoms.[33] For example, a pelvic exam, breast exam, or blood test before starting birth control pills does not appear to affect outcomes.[34][35][36] In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a detailed list of medical eligibility criteria for each type of birth control.[32]\n\nHormonal [ edit ]\n\nHormonal contraception is available in a number of different forms, including oral pills, implants under the skin, injections, patches, IUDs and a vaginal ring. They are currently available only for women, although hormonal contraceptives for men have been and are being clinically tested.[37] There are two types of oral birth control pills, the combined oral contraceptive pills (which contain both estrogen and a progestin) and the progestogen-only pills (sometimes called minipills).[38] If either is taken during pregnancy, they do not increase the risk of miscarriage nor cause birth defects.[35] Both types of birth control pills prevent fertilization mainly by inhibiting ovulation and thickening cervical mucus.[39][40] They may also change the lining of the uterus and thus decrease implantation.[40] Their effectiveness depends on the user's adherence to taking the pills.[35]\n\nCombined hormonal contraceptives are associated with a slightly increased risk of venous and arterial blood clots.[41] Venous clots, on average, increase from 2.8 to 9.8 per 10,000 women years[42] which is still less than that associated with pregnancy.[41] Due to this risk, they are not recommended in women over 35 years of age who continue to smoke.[43] Due to the increased risk, they are included in decision tools such as the DASH score and PERC rule used to predict the risk of blood clots.[44]\n\nThe effect on sexual drive is varied, with increase or decrease in some but with no effect in most.[45] Combined oral contraceptives reduce the risk of ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer and do not change the risk of breast cancer.[46][47] They often reduce menstrual bleeding and painful menstruation cramps.[35] The lower doses of estrogen released from the vaginal ring may reduce the risk of breast tenderness, nausea, and headache associated with higher dose estrogen products.[46]\n\nProgestin-only pills, injections and intrauterine devices are not associated with an increased risk of blood clots and may be used by women with a history of blood clots in their veins.[41][48] In those with a history of arterial blood clots, non-hormonal birth control or a progestin-only method other than the injectable version should be used.[41] Progestin-only pills may improve menstrual symptoms and can be used by breastfeeding women as they do not affect milk production. Irregular bleeding may occur with progestin-only methods, with some users reporting no periods.[49] The progestins drospirenone and desogestrel minimize the androgenic side effects but increase the risks of blood clots and are thus not first line.[50] The perfect use first-year failure rate of injectable progestin is 0.2%; the typical use first failure rate is 6%.[23]\n\nBarrier [ edit ]\n\nBarrier contraceptives are devices that attempt to prevent pregnancy by physically preventing sperm from entering the uterus.[51] They include male condoms, female condoms, cervical caps, diaphragms, and contraceptive sponges with spermicide.[51]\n\nGlobally, condoms are the most common method of birth control.[52] Male condoms are put on a man's erect penis and physically block ejaculated sperm from entering the body of a sexual partner.[53] Modern condoms are most often made from latex, but some are made from other materials such as polyurethane, or lamb's intestine.[53] Female condoms are also available, most often made of nitrile, latex or polyurethane.[54] Male condoms have the advantage of being inexpensive, easy to use, and have few adverse effects.[55] Making condoms available to teenagers does not appear to affect the age of onset of sexual activity or its frequency.[56] In Japan, about 80% of couples who are using birth control use condoms, while in Germany this number is about 25%,[57] and in the United States it is 18%.[58]\n\nMale condoms and the diaphragm with spermicide have typical use first-year failure rates of 18% and 12%, respectively.[23] With perfect use condoms are more effective with a 2% first-year failure rate versus a 6% first-year rate with the diaphragm.[23] Condoms have the additional benefit of helping to prevent the spread of some sexually transmitted infections such as HIV/AIDS, however, condoms made from animal intestine do not.[7][59]\n\nContraceptive sponges combine a barrier with a spermicide.[29] Like diaphragms, they are inserted vaginally before intercourse and must be placed over the cervix to be effective.[29] Typical failure rates during the first year depend on whether or not a woman has previously given birth, being 24% in those who have and 12% in those who have not.[23] The sponge can be inserted up to 24 hours before intercourse and must be left in place for at least six hours afterward.[29] Allergic reactions[60] and more severe adverse effects such as toxic shock syndrome have been reported.[61]\n\nIntrauterine devices [ edit ]\n\nCopper T shaped IUD with removal strings\n\nThe current intrauterine devices (IUD) are small devices, often 'T'-shaped, containing either copper or levonorgestrel, which are inserted into the uterus. They are one form of long-acting reversible contraception which are the most effective types of reversible birth control.[62] Failure rates with the copper IUD is about 0.8% while the levonorgestrel IUD has a failure rates of 0.2% in the first year of use.[63] Among types of birth control, they, along with birth control implants, result in the greatest satisfaction among users.[64] As of 2007 , IUDs are the most widely used form of reversible contraception, with more than 180 million users worldwide.[65]\n\nEvidence supports effectiveness and safety in adolescents[64] and those who have and have not previously had children.[66] IUDs do not affect breastfeeding and can be inserted immediately after delivery.[67] They may also be used immediately after an abortion.[68][69] Once removed, even after long term use, fertility returns to normal immediately.[70]\n\nWhile copper IUDs may increase menstrual bleeding and result in more painful cramps,[71] hormonal IUDs may reduce menstrual bleeding or stop menstruation altogether.[67] Cramping can be treated with painkillers like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.[72] Other potential complications include expulsion (2–5%) and rarely perforation of the uterus (less than 0.7%).[67][72] A previous model of the intrauterine device (the Dalkon shield) was associated with an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease; however, the risk is not affected with current models in those without sexually transmitted infections around the time of insertion.[73] IUDs appear to decrease the risk of ovarian cancer.[74]\n\nSterilization [ edit ]\n\nTwo broad categories exist, surgical and non-surgical.\n\nSurgical sterilization is available in the form of tubal ligation for women and vasectomy for men.[2] Tubal ligation decreases the risk of ovarian cancer.[2] Short term complications are twenty times less likely from a vasectomy than a tubal ligation.[2][75] After a vasectomy, there may be swelling and pain of the scrotum which usually resolves in one or two weeks.[76] Chronic scrotal pain associated with negative impact on quality of life occurs after vasectomy in about 1-2% of men.[77] With tubal ligation, complications occur in 1 to 2 percent of procedures with serious complications usually due to the anesthesia.[78] Neither method offers protection from sexually transmitted infections.[2] Sometimes, salpingectomy is also used for sterilization in women.[79]\n\nNon-surgical sterilization methods have also been explored. Fahim [80][81][82] et al. found that heat exposure, especially high-intensity ultrasound, was effective either for temporary or permanent contraception depending on the dose, e.g. selective destruction of germ cells and Sertoli cells without affecting Leydig cells or testosterone levels. Chemical, e.g. drug-based methods are also available, e.g. orally-administered Lonidamine[83] for temporary, or permanent (depending on the dose) fertility management. Boris[84] provides a method for chemically inducing either temporary or non-reversible sterility, depending on the dose, \"Permanent sterility in human males can be obtained by a single oral dosage containing from about 18 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg\".\n\nThe permanence of this decision may cause regret in some men and women. Of women who have undergone tubal ligation after the age of 30, about 6% regret their decision, as compared with 20-24% of women who received sterilization within one year of delivery and before turning 30, and 6% in nulliparous women sterilized before the age of 30.[85] By contrast, less than 5% of men are likely to regret sterilization. Men who are more likely to regret sterilization are younger, have young or no children, or have an unstable marriage.[86] In a survey of biological parents, 9% stated they would not have had children if they were able to do it over again.[87]\n\nAlthough sterilization is considered a permanent procedure,[88] it is possible to attempt a tubal reversal to reconnect the fallopian tubes or a vasectomy reversal to reconnect the vasa deferentia. In women, the desire for a reversal is often associated with a change in spouse.[88] Pregnancy success rates after tubal reversal are between 31 and 88 percent, with complications including an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy.[88] The number of males who request reversal is between 2 and 6 percent.[89] Rates of success in fathering another child after reversal are between 38 and 84 percent; with success being lower the longer the time period between the vasectomy and the reversal.[89] Sperm extraction followed by in vitro fertilization may also be an option in men.[90]\n\nBehavioral [ edit ]\n\nBehavioral methods involve regulating the timing or method of intercourse to prevent introduction of sperm into the female reproductive tract, either altogether or when an egg may be present.[91] If used perfectly the first-year failure rate may be around 3.4%; however, if used poorly first-year failure rates may approach 85%.[92]\n\nFertility awareness [ edit ]\n\nA CycleBeads tool, used for estimating fertility based on days since last menstruation\n\nFertility awareness methods involve determining the most fertile days of the menstrual cycle and avoiding unprotected intercourse.[91] Techniques for determining fertility include monitoring basal body temperature, cervical secretions, or the day of the cycle.[91] They have typical first-year failure rates of 24%; perfect use first-year failure rates depend on which method is used and range from 0.4% to 5%.[23] The evidence on which these estimates are based, however, is poor as the majority of people in trials stop their use early.[91] Globally, they are used by about 3.6% of couples.[93] If based on both basal body temperature and another primary sign, the method is referred to as symptothermal. First-year failure rates of 20% overall and 0.4% for perfect use have been reported in clinical studies of the symptothermal method.[94][23] A number of fertility tracking apps are available, as of 2016, but they are more commonly designed to assist those trying to get pregnant rather than prevent pregnancy.[95]\n\nWithdrawal [ edit ]\n\nThe withdrawal method (also known as coitus interruptus) is the practice of ending intercourse (\"pulling out\") before ejaculation.[96] The main risk of the withdrawal method is that the man may not perform the maneuver correctly or in a timely manner.[96] First-year failure rates vary from 4% with perfect usage to 22% with typical usage.[23] It is not considered birth control by some medical professionals.[29]\n\nThere is little data regarding the sperm content of pre-ejaculatory fluid.[97] While some tentative research did not find sperm,[97] one trial found sperm present in 10 out of 27 volunteers.[98] The withdrawal method is used as birth control by about 3% of couples.[93]\n\nAbstinence [ edit ]\n\nSexual abstinence may be used as a form of birth control, meaning either not engaging in any type of sexual activity, or specifically not engaging in vaginal intercourse, while engaging in other forms of non-vaginal sex.[99][100] Complete sexual abstinence is 100% effective in preventing pregnancy.[101][102] However, among those who take a pledge to abstain from premarital sex, as many as 88% who engage in sex, do so prior to marriage.[103] The choice to abstain from sex cannot protect against pregnancy as a result of rape, and public health efforts emphasizing abstinence to reduce unwanted pregnancy may have limited effectiveness, especially in developing countries and among disadvantaged groups.[104][105]\n\nDeliberate non-penetrative sex without vaginal sex or deliberate oral sex without vaginal sex are also sometimes considered birth control.[99] While this generally avoids pregnancy, pregnancy can still occur with intercrural sex and other forms of penis-near-vagina sex (genital rubbing, and the penis exiting from anal intercourse) where sperm can be deposited near the entrance to the vagina and can travel along the vagina's lubricating fluids.[106][107]\n\nAbstinence-only sex education does not reduce teenage pregnancy.[9][108] Teen pregnancy rates and STI rates are generally the same or higher in states where students are given abstinence-only education, as compared with comprehensive sex education.[108] Some authorities recommend that those using abstinence as a primary method have backup methods available (such as condoms or emergency contraceptive pills).[109]\n\nLactation [ edit ]\n\nThe lactational amenorrhea method involves the use of a woman's natural postpartum infertility which occurs after delivery and may be extended by breastfeeding.[110] For a postpartum women to be infertile (protected from pregnancy), their periods have usually not yet returned (not menstruating), they are exclusively breastfeeding the infant, and the baby is younger than six months.[26] If breastfeeding is the infant's only source of nutrition and the baby is less than 6 months old, 93-99% of women are estimated to have protection from becoming pregnant in the first six months (0.75-7.5% failure rate).[111][112] The failure rate increases to 4–7% at one year and 13% at two years.[113] Feeding formula, pumping instead of nursing, the use of a pacifier, and feeding solids all increase the chances of becoming pregnant while breastfeeding.[114] In those who are exclusively breastfeeding, about 10% begin having periods before three months and 20% before six months.[113] In those who are not breastfeeding, fertility may return as early as four weeks after delivery.[113]\n\nEmergency [ edit ]\n\nA split dose of two emergency contraceptive pills\n\nEmergency contraceptive methods are medications (sometimes misleadingly referred to as \"morning-after pills\")[115] or devices used after unprotected sexual intercourse with the hope of preventing pregnancy. Emergency contraceptives are often given to victims of rape.[10] They work primarily by preventing ovulation or fertilization.[2][116] They are unlikely to affect implantation, but this has not been completely excluded.[116] A number of options exist, including high dose birth control pills, levonorgestrel, mifepristone, ulipristal and IUDs.[117] Providing emergency contraceptive pills to women in advance does not affect rates of sexually transmitted infections, condom use, pregnancy rates, or sexual risk-taking behavior.[118][119] All methods have minimal side effects.[117]\n\nLevonorgestrel pills, when used within 3 days, decrease the chance of pregnancy after a single episode of unprotected sex or condom failure by 70% (resulting in a pregnancy rate of 2.2%).[10] Ulipristal, when used within 5 days, decreases the chance of pregnancy by about 85% (pregnancy rate 1.4%) and is more effective than levonorgestrel.[10][117][120] Mifepristone is also more effective than levonorgestrel, while copper IUDs are the most effective method.[117] IUDs can be inserted up to five days after intercourse and prevent about 99% of pregnancies after an episode of unprotected sex (pregnancy rate of 0.1 to 0.2%).[2][121] This makes them the most effective form of emergency contraceptive.[122] In those who are overweight or obese, levonorgestrel is less effective and an IUD or ulipristal is recommended.[123]\n\nDual protection [ edit ]\n\nDual protection is the use of methods that prevent both sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy.[124] This can be with condoms either alone or along with another birth control method or by the avoidance of penetrative sex.[125][126]\n\nIf pregnancy is a high concern, using two methods at the same time is reasonable.[125] For example, two forms of birth control are recommended in those taking the anti-acne drug isotretinoin or anti-epileptic drugs like carbamazepine, due to the high risk of birth defects if taken during pregnancy.[127][128]\n\nEffects [ edit ]\n\nHealth [ edit ]\n\nMaternal mortality rate as of 2010.[129]\n\nBirth control use and total fertility rate by region.\n\nContraceptive use in developing countries is estimated to have decreased the number of maternal deaths by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% of deaths if the full demand for birth control were met.[19][20] These benefits are achieved by reducing the number of unplanned pregnancies that subsequently result in unsafe abortions and by preventing pregnancies in those at high risk.[19]\n\nBirth control also improves child survival in the developing world by lengthening the time between pregnancies.[19] In this population, outcomes are worse when a mother gets pregnant within eighteen months of a previous delivery.[19][130] Delaying another pregnancy after a miscarriage, however, does not appear to alter risk and women are advised to attempt pregnancy in this situation whenever they are ready.[130]\n\nTeenage pregnancies, especially among younger teens, are at greater risk of adverse outcomes including early birth, low birth weight, and death of the infant.[14] In 2012 in the United States 82% of pregnancies in those between the ages of 15 and 19 years old are unplanned.[72] Comprehensive sex education and access to birth control are effective in decreasing pregnancy rates in this age group.[131]\n\nBirth control methods, especially hormonal methods, can also have undesirable side effects. Intensity of side effects can range from minor to debilitating, and varies with individual experiences. These most commonly include change in menstruation regularity and flow, nausea, breast tenderness, headaches, weight gain, and mood changes (specifically an increase in depression and anxiety).[132][133] Additionally, hormonal contraception can contribute to bone mineral density loss, impaired glucose metabolism, increased risk of venous thromboembolism.[133][132] Comprehensive sex education and transparent discussion of birth control side effects and contraindications between healthcare provider and patient is imperative.[132]\n\nFinances [ edit ]\n\nMap of countries by fertility rate (2020)\n\nIn the developing world, birth control increases economic growth due to there being fewer dependent children and thus more women participating in or increased contribution to the workforce - as they are usually the primary caregiver for children.[21] Women's earnings, assets, body mass index, and their children's schooling and body mass index all improve with greater access to birth control.[21] Family planning, via the use of modern birth control, is one of the most cost-effective health interventions.[134] For every dollar spent, the United Nations estimates that two to six dollars are saved.[18] These cost savings are related to preventing unplanned pregnancies and decreasing the spread of sexually transmitted illnesses.[134] While all methods are beneficial financially, the use of copper IUDs resulted in the greatest savings.[134]\n\nThe total medical cost for a pregnancy, delivery and care of a newborn in the United States is on average $21,000 for a vaginal delivery and $31,000 for a caesarean delivery as of 2012.[135] In most other countries, the cost is less than half.[135] For a child born in 2011, an average US family will spend $235,000 over 17 years to raise them.[136]\n\nPrevalence [ edit ]\n\nWorld map colored according to modern birth control use. Each shading level represents a range of six percentage points, with usage less than or equal to: 6% 12% 18% 24% 30% 36% 48% 60% 66% 78% 86% No data\n\nDemand for family planning satisfied by modern methods as of 2017.[137]\n\nGlobally, as of 2009, approximately 60% of those who are married and able to have children use birth control.[138] How frequently different methods are used varies widely between countries.[138] The most common method in the developed world is condoms and oral contraceptives, while in Africa it is oral contraceptives and in Latin America and Asia it is sterilization.[138] In the developing world overall, 35% of birth control is via female sterilization, 30% is via IUDs, 12% is via oral contraceptives, 11% is via condoms, and 4% is via male sterilization.[138]\n\nWhile less used in the developed countries than the developing world, the number of women using IUDs as of 2007 was more than 180 million.[65] Avoiding sex when fertile is used by about 3.6% of women of childbearing age, with usage as high as 20% in areas of South America.[139] As of 2005, 12% of couples are using a male form of birth control (either condoms or a vasectomy) with higher rates in the developed world.[140] Usage of male forms of birth control has decreased between 1985 and 2009.[138] Contraceptive use among women in Sub-Saharan Africa has risen from about 5% in 1991 to about 30% in 2006.[141]\n\nAs of 2012, 57% of women of childbearing age want to avoid pregnancy (867 of 1,520 million).[142] About 222 million women, however, were not able to access birth control, 53 million of whom were in sub-Saharan Africa and 97 million of whom were in Asia.[142] This results in 54 million unplanned pregnancies and nearly 80,000 maternal deaths a year.[138] Part of the reason that many women are without birth control is that many countries limit access due to religious or political reasons,[2] while another contributor is poverty.[143] Due to restrictive abortion laws in Sub-Saharan Africa, many women turn to unlicensed abortion providers for unintended pregnancy, resulting in about 2–4% obtaining unsafe abortions each year.[143]\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nEarly history [ edit ]\n\nAncient silver coin from Cyrene depicting a stalk of silphium\n\nThe Egyptian Ebers Papyrus from 1550 BC and the Kahun Papyrus from 1850 BC have within them some of the earliest documented descriptions of birth control: the use of honey, acacia leaves and lint to be placed in the vagina to block sperm.[144][145] Silphium, a species of giant fennel native to north Africa, may have been used as birth control in ancient Greece and the ancient Near East.[146][147] Due to its supposed desirability, by the first century AD, it had become so rare that it was worth more than its weight in silver and, by late antiquity, it was fully extinct.[146] Most methods of birth control used in antiquity were probably ineffective.[148]\n\nThe ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle ( c. 384–322 BC) recommended applying cedar oil to the womb before intercourse, a method which was probably only effective on occasion.[148] A Hippocratic text On the Nature of Women recommended that a woman drink a copper salt dissolved in water, which it claimed would prevent pregnancy for a year.[148] This method was not only ineffective, but also dangerous, as the later medical writer Soranus of Ephesus ( c. 98–138 AD) pointed out.[148] Soranus attempted to list reliable methods of birth control based on rational principles.[148] He rejected the use of superstition and amulets and instead prescribed mechanical methods such as vaginal plugs and pessaries using wool as a base covered in oils or other gummy substances.[148] Many of Soranus's methods were probably also ineffective.[148]\n\nIn medieval Europe, any effort to halt pregnancy was deemed immoral by the Catholic Church,[144] although it is believed that women of the time still used a number of birth control measures, such as coitus interruptus and inserting lily root and rue into the vagina.[149] Women in the Middle Ages were also encouraged to tie weasel testicles around their thighs during sex to prevent pregnancy.[150] The oldest condoms discovered to date were recovered in the ruins of Dudley Castle in England, and are dated back to 1640.[150] They were made of animal gut, and were most likely used to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases during the English Civil War.[150] Casanova, living in 18th-century Italy, described the use of a lambskin covering to prevent pregnancy; however, condoms only became widely available in the 20th century.[144]\n\nBirth control movement [ edit ]\n\n\"And the villain still pursues her\", a satirical Victorian era postcard\n\nThe birth control movement developed during the 19th and early 20th centuries.[151] The Malthusian League, based on the ideas of Thomas Malthus, was established in 1877 in the United Kingdom to educate the public about the importance of family planning and to advocate for getting rid of penalties for promoting birth control.[152] It was founded during the \"Knowlton trial\" of Annie Besant and Charles Bradlaugh, who were prosecuted for publishing on various methods of birth control.[153]\n\nIn the United States, Margaret Sanger and Otto Bobsein popularized the phrase \"birth control\" in 1914.[154][155] Sanger primarily advocated for birth control on the idea that it would prevent women from seeking unsafe abortions, but during her lifetime, she began to campaign for it on the grounds that it would reduce mental and physical defects.[156][157] She was mainly active in the United States but had gained an international reputation by the 1930s. At the time, under the Comstock Law, distribution of birth control information was illegal. She jumped bail in 1914 after her arrest for distributing birth control information and left the United States for the United Kingdom.[158] In the U.K., Sanger, influenced by Havelock Ellis, further developed her arguments for birth control. She believed women needed to enjoy sex without fearing a pregnancy. During her time abroad, Sanger also saw a more flexible diaphragm in a Dutch clinic, which she thought was a better form of contraceptive.[157] Once Sanger returned to the United States, she established a short-lived birth-control clinic with the help of her sister, Ethel Bryne, based in the Brownville section of Brooklyn, New York[159] in 1916. It was shut down after eleven days and resulted in her arrest.[160] The publicity surrounding the arrest, trial, and appeal sparked birth control activism across the United States.[161] Besides her sister, Sanger was helped in the movement by her first husband, William Sanger, who distributed copies of \"Family Limitation.\" Sanger's second husband, James Noah H. Slee, would also later become involved in the movement, acting as its main funder.[157] Sanger also contributed to the funding of research into hormonal contraceptives in the 1950s.[162] She helped fund research John Rock, and biologist Gregory Pincus that resulted in the first hormonal contraceptive pill, later called Enovid.[163] The first human trials of the pill were done on patients in the Worcester State Psychiatric Hospital, after which clinical testing was done in Puerto Rico before Enovid was approved for use in the U.S.. The people participating in these trials were not fully informed on the medical implications of the pill, and often had minimal to no other family planning options.[164][165] The newly approved birth control method was not made available to the participants after the trials, and contraceptives are still not widely accessible in Puerto Rico.[163]\n\nThe increased use of birth control was seen by some as a form of social decay.[166] A decrease of fertility was seen as a negative. Throughout the Progressive Era (1890–1920), there was an increase of voluntary associations aiding the contraceptive movement.[166] These organizations failed to enlist more than 100,000 women because the use of birth control was often compared to eugenics;[166] however, there were women seeking a community with like-minded women. The ideology that surrounded birth control started to gain traction during the Progressive Era due to voluntary associations establishing community. Birth control was unlike the Victorian Era because women wanted to manage their sexuality. The use of birth control was another form of self-interest women clung to. This was seen as women began to gravitate towards strong figures, like the Gibson Girl.[167]\n\nThe first permanent birth-control clinic was established in Britain in 1921 by Marie Stopes working with the Malthusian League.[168] The clinic, run by midwives and supported by visiting doctors,[169] offered women's birth-control advice and taught them the use of a cervical cap. Her clinic made contraception acceptable during the 1920s by presenting it in scientific terms. In 1921, Sanger founded the American Birth Control League, which later became the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.[170] In 1924 the Society for the Provision of Birth Control Clinics was founded to campaign for municipal clinics; this led to the opening of a second clinic in Greengate, Salford in 1926.[171] Throughout the 1920s, Stopes and other feminist pioneers, including Dora Russell and Stella Browne, played a major role in breaking down taboos about sex. In April 1930 the Birth Control Conference assembled 700 delegates and was successful in bringing birth control and abortion into the political sphere – three months later, the Ministry of Health, in the United Kingdom, allowed local authorities to give birth-control advice in welfare centres.[172]\n\nThe National Birth Control Association was founded in Britain in 1931, and became the Family Planning Association eight years later. The Association amalgamated several British birth control-focused groups into 'a central organisation' for administering and overseeing birth control in Britain. The group incorporated the Birth Control Investigation Committee, a collective of physicians and scientists that was founded to investigate scientific and medical aspects of contraception with 'neutrality and impartiality'.[173] Subsequently, the Association effected a series of 'pure' and 'applied' product and safety standards that manufacturers must meet to ensure their contraceptives could be prescribed as part of the Association's standard two-part-technique combining 'a rubber appliance to protect the mouth of the womb' with a 'chemical preparation capable of destroying... sperm'.[174] Between 1931 and 1959, the Association founded and funded a series of tests to assess chemical efficacy and safety and rubber quality.[175] These tests became the basis for the Association's Approved List of contraceptives, which was launched in 1937, and went on to become an annual publication that the expanding network of FPA clinics relied upon as a means to 'establish facts [about contraceptives] and to publish these facts as a basis on which a sound public and scientific opinion can be built'.[176]\n\nIn 1936, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled in United States v. One Package of Japanese Pessaries that medically prescribing contraception to save a person's life or well-being was not illegal under the Comstock Laws. Following this decision, the American Medical Association Committee on Contraception revoked its 1936 statement condemning birth control.[citation needed] A national survey in 1937 showed 71 percent of the adult population supported the use of contraception.[citation needed] By 1938, 374 birth control clinics were running in the United States despite their advertisement still being illegal.[177] First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt publicly supported birth control and family planning.[178] The restrictions on birth control in the Comstock laws were effectively rendered null and void by Supreme Court decisions Griswold v. Connecticut (1965)[179] and Eisenstadt v. Baird (1972).[180] In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson started endorsing public funding for family planning services, and the Federal Government began subsidizing birth control services for low-income families.[181] The Affordable Care Act, passed into law on March 23, 2010, under President Barack Obama, requires all plans in the Health Insurance Marketplace to cover contraceptive methods. These include barrier methods, hormonal methods, implanted devices, emergency contraceptives, and sterilization procedures.[182]\n\nModern methods [ edit ]\n\nIn 1909, Richard Richter developed the first intrauterine device made from silkworm gut, which was further developed and marketed in Germany by Ernst Gräfenberg in the late 1920s.[183] In 1951, an Austrian-born American chemist, named Carl Djerassi at Syntex in Mexico City made the hormones in progesterone pills using Mexican yams (Dioscorea mexicana).[184] Djerassi had chemically created the pill but was not equipped to distribute it to patients. Meanwhile, Gregory Pincus and John Rock with help from the Planned Parenthood Federation of America developed the first birth control pills in the 1950s, such as mestranol/noretynodrel, which became publicly available in the 1960s through the Food and Drug Administration under the name Enovid.[170][185] Medical abortion became an alternative to surgical abortion with the availability of prostaglandin analogs in the 1970s and mifepristone in the 1980s.[186]\n\nSociety and culture [ edit ]\n\nLegal positions [ edit ]\n\nHuman rights agreements require most governments to provide family planning and contraceptive information and services. These include the requirement to create a national plan for family planning services, remove laws that limit access to family planning, ensure that a wide variety of safe and effective birth control methods are available including emergency contraceptives, make sure there are appropriately trained healthcare providers and facilities at an affordable price, and create a process to review the programs implemented. If governments fail to do the above it may put them in breach of binding international treaty obligations.[187]\n\nIn the United States, the 1965 Supreme Court decision Griswold v. Connecticut overturned a state law prohibiting dissemination of contraception information based on a constitutional right to privacy for marital relationships. In 1972, Eisenstadt v. Baird extended this right to privacy to single people.[188]\n\nIn 2010, the United Nations launched the Every Woman Every Child movement to assess the progress toward meeting women's contraceptive needs. The initiative has set a goal of increasing the number of users of modern birth control by 120 million women in the world's 69 poorest countries by 2020. Additionally, they aim to eradicate discrimination against girls and young women who seek contraceptives.[189] The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommended in 2014 that oral birth control pills should be over the counter medications.[190]\n\nSince at least the 1870s, American religious, medical, legislative, and legal commentators have debated contraception laws. Ana Garner and Angela Michel have found that in these discussions men often attach reproductive rights to moral and political matters, as part of an ongoing attempt to regulate human bodies. In press coverage between 1873 and 2013 they found a divide between institutional ideology and real-life experiences of women.[191]\n\nReligious views [ edit ]\n\nReligions vary widely in their views of the ethics of birth control.[192] The Roman Catholic Church re-affirmed its teachings in 1968 that only natural family planning is permissible,[193] although large numbers of Catholics in developed countries accept and use modern methods of birth control.[194][195][196] The Greek Orthodox Church admits a possible exception to its traditional teaching forbidding the use of artificial contraception, if used within marriage for certain purposes, including the spacing of births.[197] Among Protestants, there is a wide range of views from supporting none, such as in the Quiverfull movement, to allowing all methods of birth control.[198] Views in Judaism range from the stricter Orthodox sect, which prohibits all methods of birth control, to the more relaxed Reform sect, which allows most.[199] Hindus may use both natural and modern contraceptives.[200] A common Buddhist view is that preventing conception is acceptable, while intervening after conception has occurred is not.[201] In Islam, contraceptives are allowed if they do not threaten health, although their use is discouraged by some.[202]\n\nWorld Contraception Day [ edit ]\n\nSeptember 26 is World Contraception Day, devoted to raising awareness and improving education about sexual and reproductive health, with a vision of a world where every pregnancy is wanted.[203] It is supported by a group of governments and international NGOs, including the Office of Population Affairs, the Asian Pacific Council on Contraception, Centro Latinamericano Salud y Mujer, the European Society of Contraception and Reproductive Health, the German Foundation for World Population, the International Federation of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology, International Planned Parenthood Federation, the Marie Stopes International, Population Services International, the Population Council, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and Women Deliver.[203]\n\nMisconceptions [ edit ]\n\nThere are a number of common misconceptions regarding sex and pregnancy.[204] Douching after sexual intercourse is not an effective form of birth control.[205] Additionally, it is associated with a number of health problems and thus is not recommended.[206] Women can become pregnant the first time they have sexual intercourse[207] and in any sexual position.[208] It is possible, although not very likely, to become pregnant during menstruation.[209] Contraceptive use, regardless of its duration and type, does not have a negative effect on the ability of women to conceive following termination of use and does not significantly delay fertility. Women who use oral contraceptives for a longer duration may have a slightly lower rate of pregnancy than do women using oral contraceptives for a shorter period of time, possibly due to fertility decreasing with age.[210]\n\nAccessibility [ edit ]\n\nAccess to birth control may be affected by finances and the laws within a region or country.[211] In the United States African American, Hispanic, and young women are disproportionately affected by limited access to birth control, as a result of financial disparity.[212][213] For example, Hispanic and African American women often lack insurance coverage and are more often poor.[214] New immigrants in the United States are not offered preventive care such as birth control.[215]\n\nIn the United Kingdom contraception can be obtained free of charge via contraception clinics, sexual health or GUM (genitourinary medicine) clinics, via some GP surgeries, some young people's services and pharmacies.[216][217]\n\nIn September 2021, France announced that women aged under 25 in France will be offered free contraception from 2022. It was elaborated that they \"would not be charged for medical appointments, tests, or other medical procedures related to birth control\" and that this would \"cover hormonal contraception, biological tests that go with it, the prescription of contraception and all care related to this contraception\".[218]\n\nFrom August 2022 onwards contraception for women aged between 17 and 25 years will be free in the Republic of Ireland.[219][220]\n\nAdvocacy [ edit ]\n\nFree the Pill, a collaboration between Advocates for Youth and Ibis Reproductive Health are working to bring birth control over-the-counter, covered by insurance with no age-restriction throughout the United States.[221][222][223]\n\nApproval [ edit ]\n\nOn July 13, 2023 the first US daily oral nonprescription over-the-counter birth control pill was approved for manufacturer by the FDA. The pill, Opill is expected to be more effective in preventing unintended pregnancies than condoms are. Opill is expected to be available in 2024 but the price has yet to be set. Perrigo, a pharmaceutical company based in Dublin is the manufacturer. [224]\n\nResearch directions [ edit ]\n\nFemales [ edit ]\n\nImprovements of existing birth control methods are needed, as around half of those who get pregnant unintentionally are using birth control at the time.[29] A number of alterations of existing contraceptive methods are being studied, including a better female condom, an improved diaphragm, a patch containing only progestin, and a vaginal ring containing long-acting progesterone.[225] This vaginal ring appears to be effective for three or four months and is currently available in some areas of the world.[225] For women who rarely have sex, the taking of the hormonal birth control levonorgestrel around the time of sex looks promising.[226]\n\nA number of methods to perform sterilization via the cervix are being studied. One involves putting quinacrine in the uterus which causes scarring and infertility. While the procedure is inexpensive and does not require surgical skills, there are concerns regarding long-term side effects.[227] Another substance, polidocanol, which functions in the same manner is being looked at.[225] A device called Essure, which expands when placed in the fallopian tubes and blocks them, was approved in the United States in 2002.[227] In 2016, a black boxed warning regarding potentially serious side effects was added,[228][229] and in 2018, the device was discontinued.[230]\n\nMales [ edit ]\n\nCurrent common methods of male birth control include condoms, vasectomies and withdrawal.[231][232]\n\nA number of novel contraceptive methods based on hormonal and non-hormonal mechanisms of action are in various stages of research and development, up to and including clinical trials.[233][234][235][236][237][238] Methods in development include long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs), daily transdermal gels and oral pills, injectables, implants, wearables, and oral on-demand contraceptives.[239][240][241]\n\nMen consistently report high levels of interest in novel forms of male contraception.[242][243][244] Development of novel male contraceptive methods has been ongoing for many decades, but progress been stymied by a lack of industry involvement.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "The main difference between sigma bonds and pi bonds is that sigma bonds are stronger and more directional, while pi bonds are weaker and less directional.", "reference_documents": ["[1] Pi bonds are formed by the sidewise positive (same phase) overlap of atomic orbitals along a direction perpendicular to the internuclear axis. During the formation of π bonds, the axes of the atomic orbitals are parallel to each other whereas the overlapping is perpendicular to the internuclear axis. This type of covalent bonding is illustrated below.[Image: Pi Bonds]Pi Bonds are generally weaker than sigma bonds, owing to the significantly lower degree of overlapping. Generally, double bonds consist of one sigma and one pi bond, whereas a typical triple bond is made up of two π bonds and one σ bond. It is important to note that a combination of sigma and pi bonds is always stronger than a single sigma bond.\n\n[2] In chemistry, sigma bonds (σ bonds) are the strongest type of covalent chemical bond.[1] They are formed by head-on overlapping between atomic orbitals. Sigma bonding is most simply defined for diatomic molecules using the language and tools of symmetry groups. In this formal approach, a σ-bond is symmetrical with respect to rotation about the bond axis. By this definition, common forms of sigma bonds are s+s, p_z+p_z, s+p_z and d z^2+d z^2 (where z is defined as the axis of the bond or the internuclear axis).[2] Quantum theory also indicates that molecular orbitals (MO) of identical symmetry actually mix or hybridize. As a practical consequence of this mixing of diatomic molecules, the wavefunctions s+s and p_z+p_z molecular orbitals become blended. The extent of this mixing (or hybridization or blending) depends on the relative energies of the MOs of like symmetry.\n\n[3] A sigma bond is stronger than a pi bond. The reason is that the overlapping of atomic orbitals can take place to a greater extent during the formation of a sigma bond, whereas overlapping of orbitals occurs to a smaller extent during the formation of a pi bond.\nA pi bond between two atoms is formed only in addition to a sigma bond. The reason is that the atoms constituting a single bond prefer to form a strong sigma bond rather than a weak pi bond.\nThus, a pi bond is always present in molecules with multiple bonds, i.e., double or triple bonds. In other words, a single bond cannot be a pi bond.\nThere can be free rotation of atoms around the sigma bonds. Free rotation of atoms around pi bonds is not possible because it involves breaking the pi bonds."], "label": "AMBIG", "category": "Lfqa", "additional_info": {"original_label": "NS"}}

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "The original lyrics were recently sold at auction for $1.2 million to an anonymous buyer.", "reference_documents": ["\"A long, long, time ago...\" Those five words, when uttered or sung, makes baby boomers immediately think of Don McLean's pop masterpiece \"American Pie.\"  It's hard to believe that his phenomenal 8½ minute allegory, which millions of Americans know by heart, is 44 years old.  All sorts of historical cross-currents play off each other in this timeless song, brilliantly gilded with the unforgettable chorus, which starts as \"Bye, Bye, Miss American Pie.\" There is no real way to categorize McLean's \"American Pie\" for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad, beer-hall chant and high-art rock. On Tuesday, Christie's sold the 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song's lyrics for $1.2 million to an unnamed buyer. McLean was a paperboy when, on February 3, 1959, he saw that Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson had been tragically killed in an airplane crash in Clear Lake, Iowa. \"The next day I went to school in shock and guess what?\" McLean recalled.  \"Nobody cared.  Rock 'n' roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and Buddy hadn't had a big hit on the charts since '57.\"  By cathartically writing \"American Pie,\" McLean has guaranteed that the memory of those great musicians lives forever. Having recorded his first album, \"Tapestry,\" in 1969, in Berkeley, California, during the student riots, McLean, a native New Yorker, became a kind of weather vane for what he called the \"generation lost in space.\"   When his cultural anthem \"American Pie\" was released in November 1971, it replaced Bob Dylan's \"The Times They Are A Changin\" as the Peoples Almanac of the new decade.  It's important to think of \"American Pie\" as one would of Henry Longfellow's \"Evangeline\" or Johnny Mercer's \"Moon River\" -- an essential Americana poem emanating wistful recollection, blues valentine, and youthful protest rolled into one.  There is magic brewing in the music and words of \"American Pie,\" for McLean's lyrics and melody frame a cosmic dream, like those Jack Kerouac tried to conjure in his poetry-infused novel \"On the Road.\" Don McLean: Buddy Holly, rest in peace. Influenced by Pete Seeger and the Weavers, McLean proudly wore the mantle of troubadour in the early 1970s, when \"American Pie\" topped the Billboard charts, and has never shed the cape.   Wandering far and wide, singing \"American Pie\" at windblown dance halls in Wyoming and cloistered colleges in New England, at huge amphitheaters in California and little coffee houses in the Hudson River Valley, McLean has performed his global anthem thousands of times.  Yet the encore number never loses its transfixing allure. When McLean prods audiences by rhapsodizing \"and they were singing\" everybody spontaneously joins in with the \"Bye, Bye\" chorus.  Watching McLean deliver his most notable song in concert is to take part in a collective Happening. What makes \"American Pie\" so unusual is that it isn't a relic from the counterculture but a talisman, which, like a sacred river, keeps bringing joy to listeners everywhere.  When \"American Pie\" suddenly is played on a jukebox or radio it's almost impossible not to sing along.   Like \"Danny Boy\" or \"Streets of Laredo\" or \"Shenandoah,\" it's eternal.  With illusions to football fields and rock 'n' roll, river levees and nursery rhymes, the song cascades along like a boat going down Niagara Falls or a roller coaster that jumps tracks but floats instead of crashes. After all these years, \"American Pie\" still makes me feel empowered and yet filled with a sense of loss.  The song is alive and joyful, yet fretful about a world gone wrong.  It is a song that will never die.  A reverie for the ages.   There is a jump to the chorus, which forces the mind to relive the '50s, '60s and '70s, to troll through the back pages of our lives while, like a traditional Irish folksong, it reminds us of fate. While McLean, the muse, has rightfully not tried to interpret \"American Pie,\" it's fair to surmise that \"the king\" is Elvis Presley, \"Helter Skelter\" refers to the Charles Manson murders, the \"jester on the sidelines in a cast\" is Bob Dylan, and \"Jack Flash\" the Rolling Stones.  But who knows?  The lyric remains a puzzle open to thousands of spirited interpretations.  As a literary artifact of the early 1970s, there isn't anything to compare to \"American Pie.\" Normally, I don't like rankings of literature or songs or even presidents, for that matter.  But the fact that the Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment of the Arts chose \"American Pie\" as the fifth greatest song of the 20th century speaks to the composition's importance as an enduring piece of pop art.  The other four were \"Over the Rainbow\" (by Harold Arlen and E.Y \"Yip\" Harburg), \"White Christmas \"(by Irving Berlin), \"This Land is Your Land\" (by Woody Guthrie) and \"Respect\" (by Otis Redding).  That is fine company. Quite simply, \"American Pie\" is one of the greatest songs ever written.  And Tuesday the original lyrics found a new home.\n"], "label": "AMBIG", "category": "RAGTruth", "additional_info": {"original_label": "NS"}}

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "Jacob Lawrence's series of 60 paintings, \"The Migration of the Negro,\" depicts the experiences of millions of African Americans who migrated from the South to the North during the Great Migration (1916-1970) in search of better opportunities.", "reference_documents": ["Jacob Lawrence's groundbreaking work, \"The Migration of the Negro,\" is a series of 60 small paintings with text depicting the lives of millions of pre-World War II blacks as they moved from the oppressive South to the promise of a better life in the North. One frame in particular, No. 22, shows three black men dressed in their Sunday best, handcuffed, heads bowed standing in front of a window adorned with prison bars. The caption reads:. \"Another of the social causes of the migrants' leaving was that at times they did not feel safe, or it was not the best thing to be found on the streets late at night. They were arrested on the slightest provocation.\" Lawrence painted this picture around 1940. This is important to know because there are some people who blame President Barack Obama for racial tension in America as if the March on Washington scrubbed away the lasting effects of 300 years of inequality. No. 22 was painted before hip-hop became the piñata for conservative talk show hosts to bash and before sagging pants became a popular fashion statement. Some of us keep looking for a new reason why this old problem continues to haunt us because to think otherwise requires effort. It's a lot easier to retweet a Dr. King meme. It is more convenient to say the violence began when rioters threw bricks at police and not when a city's Police Department began terrorizing its residents. We criticize Baltimore's mayor for not \"restoring order\" as if paying victims of police brutality nearly $6 million in a four-year span is \"order.\" Now, some people are partially blaming the 2013 movie \"The Purge\" for the uprising in Baltimore as if the 1996 riots in St. Petersburg, Florida, happened on a different planet. Or that the more than 100 cases of Baltimore police brutality that were either lost or settled out of court since 2011 provide no insight as to what the residents have been dealing with for some time. An 87-year-old grandmother had her shoulder broken by overzealous police, and Sen. Rand Paul -- God bless him -- suggested the rise in absentee fathers is the reason for this latest clash. It is true only 34% of black children live in a two-family household today, and I do believe that is a problem. Soul searching, as the President suggested, is something that needs to be had by all. But it is also true that 65% of black children lived with both parents in 1960, and yet there was still a lack of trust between the police and the minority community. Sen. Paul's rationale falls apart when you consider that John Henry Crawford III was shot and killed by police at a Walmart in Ohio while on the phone talking with the mother of his two children. Crawford's father was literally playing with his two grandchildren as his son was being gunned down. In 1971, Marvin Gaye cracked the Top 10 on the pop charts with \"Inner City Blues,\" which included the lines:. Crime is increasing. Trigger happy policing. Panic is spreading. God knows where we're heading. And yet so many look at the protests, uprisings and yes, sometimes riots, with this incredulous demeanor as if the raw emotions captured on camera are materializing out of thin air. No backdrop. No historical context. Television journalists asking questions that seem to characterize the recent developments as unexplained anger detached from any tangible issue. It is as if they believe the absence of burning crosses translated into peace and harmony. Meanwhile, Louisiana state police want people to believe Victor White III shot himself in the chest while handcuffed sitting in the back of a police car. How can there be peace when the Department of Justice found black residents in Ferguson were preyed upon for years by a corrupt Police Department? Where is the harmony when the average white household has 13 times the wealth of its black counterpart? And we know the impact wealth has on education, housing and mortality. Now there is video of police in Inkster, Michigan, celebrating the beating of a suspect as he sits nearby with broken ribs, a head injury and bleeding. The officers fist pump and laugh. One of them even appears to joyfully re-enact parts of the incident in plain view of Floyd Dent, the man in custody. And when the incident in question was under investigation, the Inkster Police Department suppressed the video. Two months would go by before the public saw what we are paying for. But at least we saw it. In Chicago, the police department has yet to release dash cam video of the fatal encounter officers had with 17-year-old Laquan McDonald last October. The report said an officer fired shots into McDonald's chest after the teen lunged at them with a knife. Witnesses said the shooting was unjustified. The autopsy shows McDonald was shot 16 times from a variety of angles by the officer. The City Council recently approved a $5 million settlement but maintains there was no wrongdoing. The video could shed some light on what really happened...which may explain why we have yet to see it. This comes on the heels of Mayor Rahm Emanuel establishing a $5.5 million reparations fund for victims of former CPD commander John Burge. For three decades Burge and his team ran a torture ring that used electric shock, burned and beat up more than 100 black men. And some look at Baltimore and the protests happening all around the country and wonder where all of this rage is coming from? This mistrust didn't come from somewhere. It's always been here. Woven in the comedic deliveries of Richard Pryor, Dick Gregory and Dave Chappelle; saturated within the prose of Lorraine Hansberry, Maya Angelou and Shonda Rhimes; heard in soulful cries of Billie Holiday's \"Strange Fruit\" to John Legend standing on an Oscar stage singing \"one day, when the glory comes it will be ours.\" For decades, the works of black artists have explicitly talked about the Baltimores of this country and though their work has been celebrated and curated, the message remains lost. Why else would someone believe sagging pants and hoodies are to blame for mass incarcerations? That President Obama is the reason why some blacks are frustrated with police and not the dynamic beautifully captured by Lawrence 75 years ago. Before President Richard Nixon started the war on drugs. Before Eric Garner started selling loose cigarettes in Staten Island. Before Baltimore became the setting of a critically acclaimed TV show. There isn't a new reason why Freddie Gray's death triggered outrage. Just new ways for people to validate apathy and explain away racism.\n"], "label": "AMBIG", "category": "RAGTruth", "additional_info": {"original_label": "NS"}}

Bush says the country's legal system has little rhyme or reason.\nVICTOR CHA, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY, CSIS KOREA CHAIR: I think what you would expect to see is something in between a prison sentence to, you know, perhaps even sentencing to some sort of labor camp. Hopefully, those will just be a token sort of punishment.\nCARROLL: Again, the trial is set for Thursday.

Our guest this morning is bringing us his first live interview from Williamsburg, where he is at the convention of CEOs. Sandy Weill is chairman and chief executive of Travelers -- or Citigroup now it is known, and is joining us from the Business Council Summit in West Virginia. We welcome you.\nSANDFORD WEILL, CITIGROUP CHAIRMAN & CEO: Thank you.\nDAVID HAFFENREFFER, CNN ANCHOR: Mr. Weill, I do want to begin, first of all, with the Federal Reserve. Everybody is seemingly talking about their expectations for what the Federal Reserve will be doing come Tuesday. Are you in the 25 or 50 basis point camp, and what are your impressions of the Fed's strategy for shaping the economy now?\nWEILL: Well, you know, I think the Fed has been trying to cool off the economy for the last year. We've had five 25 basis point increases already, and I would expect, as everybody else does, that we will have another one this coming week. Whether they do 25 basis points and continue to say that there's an outlook for further increases or they do 50 now and indicate, possibly, that they may slow down in the increases, I don't think it's really that important. I think that what they have done is beginning to affect the economy, and I think we're beginning to see the beginning of a slowdown in the economy.\nMARCHINI: It certainly has affected the stock market, we're seeing intense amounts of volatility there. What does that say to you?\nWEILL: Well, I think that we really went through a period where there was indiscriminate buying of a lot of the high-tech stocks, and I think when you think about the Internet, it's going to really revolutionize and transform our global economies, but yet, a lot of these companies that are public today won't be in existence five years from now. But I do believe that the value of all those technology stocks five years from now, as a collective, will be a lot higher than it is today.\nHAFFENREFFER: Are you concerned how a higher interest rate environment here in the U.S. might impact your shares of Citigroup?\nWEILL: I think our company is not really that affected by interest-rate increases of 100 or 150 basis points. We had had over a hundred basis point increase in rates, and yet, in the first quarter, we earned $3.6 billion, which was up 50 percent from the year before. So our company is doing very well.\nMARCHINI: When you look at the economy overall, what's your sense of it? Do you think that things are going along well?\nWEILL: You know, I think that the U.S. economy was really growing too fast, that the labor market got very, very tight, which is creating a problem for a whole host of companies in being difficult to replace workers and costs are going up somewhat. So I think that the U.S. economy cooling down a low bit is good. However, if you look around a world, the global economy is really in terrific shape: Asia's growing, Latin America's growing, Europe is starting to grow. So I think we are in an environment, from a global perspective, that is really terrific. And since this world is becoming a smaller place and we trade with each other much, much more, I think that that's really the important key to the outlook, so therefore I'm very optimistic.\nHAFFENREFFER: You speak of global growth and international growth. Yesterday, Citigroup took one step closer to the purchase of Poland's biggest corporate bank. Is Citigroup essentially done expanding in the U.S. and more angling toward growth overseas?\nWEILL: I think that we still like the U.S. market for financial services and are looking to grow some parts of our business, but we think that the growth rate in the emerging markets is going to be far higher than that in the United States. So, as you mentioned, we're buying Bank Hanloi (ph) in Poland. We're very optimistic about the Polish economy long-term. Last week, I was in Asia and we announced a strategic relationship with the Fubon Group in Taiwan with an intention to grow our insurance businesses through Asia together with them.\nMARCHINI: All right, well, clearly, you're going to be a busy man.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "PTSD symptoms in kids include regression, difficulty sleeping, and changes in play.", "reference_documents": ["BLITZER: Connecticut state police confirm today, just a little while ago indeed, that Adam Lanza fired what they call hundreds of bullet, hundreds, at the Sandy Hook Elementary school on Friday and you a number of weapons with him. We are live from the Lanza home, in just a moment with that investigation, standby for that. Also, we are awaiting the arrival of President Obama. He is due here in Newtown shortly. He is going to speak with the families of the 26 people, most of them elementary school children who were shot dead Friday morning. Stay with CNN for that. You will see the president live right here when he arrives. And of course, that interfaith vigil, the entirety, all of it we will bring it to you live. Let's go out to the home where Adam Lanza lived with his mother that home is also right now a crime scene because it appears in Lanza's mother was killed -- killed in the home before the shooting rampage over at the elementary school. CNN's Alison Kosik is joining us now from the Lanza home. Alison, the state police, Connecticut state police, they just gave us an update. For those of the viewers weren't watching CNN live, tell us the main points that the police made.\nALISON KOSIK, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The state police say that Adam Lanza shot and killed his mother, shooting her multiple times inside the house that is in this neighborhood where I'm standing right now. Police still have the street leading up to his house blocked off. You know, there hasn't been much activity since yesterday afternoon, up until about -- I would say a little over an hour ago, we watched about six police cars drive up several officials got out of their car, talked a built and then got back in the cars and drove off, we assume to Adam Lanza's house. Now, what we did learn throughout the day from state police is that their focus is really was on this school. And what they found was that four weapons were found at the school, three were found in the classroom a shotgun was found in Lanza's car that was parked outside the school. We also learned that Lanza mostly used a semiautomatic weapon called a Bushmaster inside the school to kill those 26 people inside the school. He had, as you said, he shot dozens of bullets and he had hundreds of unused ammunition as well, hundreds of bullets that were not even used. So, it was clear why the medical examiner came out yesterday and explained how Adam Lanza shot those 26 people multiple times, some of them, he shot, said the medical examiner, three to 11 times. It's clear that Lanza carrying that much ammunition on him was looking to cause the most destruction and death - Wolf.\nBLITZER: What a horrific, horrific crime. Alison, thank you so much. So, what happened Friday will make Monday, certainly, a huge challenge for so many families. Let's bring in our chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta who is here with us now. Posttraumatic stress disorder that is going to be a huge problem.\nDR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: It is. And you know, we are used to talking about this in the context over adults but it can happen in children and it can happen quickly. I think that's two things people don't always realize. And you know, how the children behave now, how a lot of these things are implemented that you've been talking about with people over the last couple of days, is going to make a big difference, if certain conversations had had. If special care is taken to make sure that children are sleeping well, for example. They are going to be able to cope much better in the long runs. So, you can predict, you know, certain likelihood of success in terms of that coping by what's happening the next few days.\nBLITZER: We think of posttraumatic stress disorder, troops coming home from Afghanistan or Iraq. This is obviously very different than that. But, what are the symptoms? What should we be looking forward to? This is a very serious illness.\nGUPTA: In adults, you know, you think about things like hyper vigilance, difficulty sleeping, very quick and almost hasty reaction. In children, it can be very different. Sometimes don't verbalize it hard late all, changes in how they play. They may, in fact, start playing, you know, toy guns or something like that if they didn't before. They can have regression. So, a 6-year-old can start acting like a younger child, for example. And again, just paying attention to those things and not sort of glossing over, obviously don't want to provide graphic details, make sure you are having conversations. Tomorrow, kids go back to school. They don't know about what happened yet, they probably will by tomorrow.\nBLITZER: I'm sure they will. And if their parents didn't tell them, teachers might tell them or their classmates would tell them.\nGUPTA: Social media.\nBLITZER: Yes. They will hear about. And Sanjay is going to be with us throughout the night. We are awaiting the president of the United States. He is coming here to Newtown to bring some comfort to the families, the first responders. Also, he will participate in the interfaith vigil that will be taking place here in Connecticut.

Management calls it, quote, “accelerated attrition,“ end quote. And it is only the latest sign of the dramatic decline of the American automobile industry and the continued assault on working men and women in this country. General Motors reporting a $10.6 billion loss in 2005. The company continues to lose market share. Hourly employees will be eligible for lump sum payments of up to as much as $140,000 depending on years of service. Bankrupt auto parts supplier Delphi also offer a buyout to 13,000 employees who can receive up to $35,000. General Motors hoping that these buyouts will help it meet its goal of cutting 30,000 jobs by 2008. Ford also planning to eliminate 30,000 jobs, Daimler Chrysler has a goal of 40,000 jobs.

Consumers personal information is a billion-dollar business for data brokers and marketers in this country. Now the Internal Revenue Service believes the information in your tax return should be for sale, to them. And for the first time, it wants to allow accountants and tax preparation companies such as H&R; Block to sell your personal information. Lisa Sylvester reports.\nLISA SYLVESTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Your tax returns are in many ways a map of your entire life. How much you make, your medical cost, charitable donations. It's all there. An Internal Revenue Service proposal would allow tax preparers to sell that information to marketing companies and data brokers.\nBETH GIVENS, PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARINGHOUSE: I think this is a shockingly bad idea, to allow tax preparers to sell these very sensitive documents. The information contained tells a lot about us, about our families.\nSYLVESTER: The IRS ironically claims that its doing this to improve consumer protections. The agency argues that it would require consent before tax returns could be sent overseas for processing or disclosed to third parties. In a statement, the IRS commissioner said, “The heart of this proposed regulation is about the right of taxpayers to control their tax return information.“ But many consumers could unwittingly sign away their privacy.\nPETER SWIRE, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS: The permission here is fake permission. The accountant sets all the little tabs out there and little red tabs and says sign here in all these places. And then you sign the consent and your record is now being sold to a database company.\nSYLVESTER: It's hard to see why consumers would want to have their information sold.\nBETH MCCONNELL, PENN. PIRG: I think it's incredibly significant, not only given the epidemic of identity theft that affects more than 9 million Americans every single year, but also just the barrage of marketing and advertising that consumers are already having a hard time controlling.\nSYLVESTER: Consumer groups say for individuals, there's nothing to gain by having their records sold and everything to lose.\nSYLVESTER: H&R; Block did not return our calls for comment on this story. And there's a real sense that the IRS was trying to fly this one in under the radar. It called the change not a significant regulatory action, although most taxpayers would probably beg to differ, Lou.\nDOBBS: Well, it is under the heading of, you can't make this stuff up. The Internal Revenue Service saying that we would be sharing our personal tax information to protect the privacy of our tax information. It's Orwellian. It's breathtaking and we thank you, Lisa Sylvester. A reminder now to vote in our poll.

They are not confirming that it is Pistorius, although it is important to note that Pistorius is 26 years old. We are also finding out about previous incidents at his home of a domestic nature.

U.S. Airways and bankrupt American Airlines have agreed to a merger.\nSAMBOLIN: But what does it mean for you, the flier? Christine Romans has details in “Road Warriors“.\nCHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Because it's all about us in the end, isn't it? The goal is a more efficient, more profitable airline, but that's going to take some time. Airline mergers generally take a few years, so for now get ready for some logistical headaches. One analyst we talked to says the bigger the merger, the more problems there are. First, combining the computer systems isn't easy. So, there could be some reservation problems initially. We can look at one of the most recent mergers for a clue. United and Continental -- in January, 2012, the first month the government combined data of those carriers, it showed customer complaints shot up 198 percent. Most of the complaints are about flight problems, cancellations, delays and reservations and ticketing problems. These two airlines also have to combine their frequent flier programs. They're going to have to woo back business travelers that American lost with all of those canceled flights this fall because of a pilot sickout. Here's travel expert Mark Murphy on some of the benefits of the deal.\nMARK MURPHY, TRAVEL EXPERT: This merger will provide the traveler with better connections. I think you're going to be in nine major hubs between the two carriers now with the merger. So you're going to be able to get where you want to go more efficiently and effectively.\nROMANS: All right. So those nine major hubs are all over the country giving people a lot of access. Look at where they are. Not a lot of overlap. Really the only overlap in Chicago and Phoenix. Because of that and because the economy is still weak, many travel experts are telling us that ticket prices probably won't go up. Now, we should also point out that sources close to the boards have told us that the boards have agreed there's a lot of work to do here. An announcement today likely and then we'll wait to se what the bankruptcy judge says and what federal regulators say about this big, big deal.\nBERMAN: Usually changes need to be made before it's finalized but they manage to push it through.\nROMANS: That's right. Absolutely.\nSAMBOLIN: John pointed out perhaps they could double our miles. So --\nROMANS: No details on your frequent flier plan but I will find out as soon as this deal is official.\nSAMBOLIN: We appreciate that. Thank you. All right. Nineteen minutes past the hour.

I'm also humbled, not just by the closeness of this election, but by the enormity of the responsibility that comes with this office. We have a lot of work to do in Washington, but that's why I signed up for the job in the first place.

I know there's been a lot of talk about the fact that when I'm sworn in, I'll be the 60th member of the Democratic Caucus. But that's -- that's not how I see it. The way I see it, I'm not going to Washington to be the 60th Democratic senator, I'm going to Washington to be the second senator from the State of Minnesota. And that's how I'm going to do this job.\nMALVEAUX: Minnesota's new senator, Al Franken, saying he is ready to go to work for his state. I want to bring in own Gloria Borger to kind of give us a lay of the land here. Obviously, it's a race that everybody has been following for quite some time. This is the next step now. What -- what does this mean for -- for the Democrats now that they have a larger majority?\nGLORIA BORGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, it means that they've got 60 seats, which would give them a filibuster-proof majority. But that's assuming that Democrats, and two Independents who we include in that, would agree on everything which is, of course, a large assumption that is not necessarily true.\nMALVEAUX: Sure.\nBORGER: But, of course, they'll take every vote they can get at this point. Don't forget, this has been a hotly contested fight over these last eight months -- very divisive, splitting the parties in the Senate, leaving the State of Minnesota unrepresented. And so I think that a lot of people on both sides of the aisle are kind of breathing a sigh of relief that it's -- that it's finally over, no matter how it was decided.\nMALVEAUX: Do you think it helps the Obama administration and the president pushing forward some of the things that have been so difficult for him, whether it's energy or health care?\nBORGER: Sure.\nMALVEAUX: Obviously...\nBORGER: Yes. Sure. I think it does. I mean, look, a vote is a vote is a vote. And I think Al Franken's politics are clearly more on the liberal side. So he would be more likely to go along with Barack Obama on things like climate change, on things like health care reform, than somebody like Democrat Ben Nelson of Nebraska, who's much more of a moderate who he may lose on certain votes.\nMALVEAUX: Sure.\nBORGER: So I think that they would look at Franken as much more dependable.\nMALVEAUX: OK. Gloria Borger making sense of all of this. Thank you so much.\nBORGER: Sure.\nMALVEAUX: One of Michael Jackson's prized acquisitions was the rights to a vast Beatles music library. Well, what is -- what will happen to that practically priceless catalog now? Iranian leaders say the election is confirmed and they will tolerate no more protests. But what happens to those arrested during the uprising? Will their families ever see them again?"], "label": "AMBIG", "category": "TofuEval-MediaS", "additional_info": {"original_label": "NS"}}

The International Olympic Committee has elected Jacques Rogge of Belgium to an eight-year term, replacing Juan Antonio Samaranch, of Spain. The two met with reporters in Moscow, including our Patrick Snell, who's there.\nPATRICK SNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Colleen, that's right: the Samaranch era has officially come to an end after 21 years. Now all eyes will be focusing on the 59-year old orthopedic surgeon from Belgium, Jacques Rogge. Out of all the candidates, in terms of sporting politics, he was perhaps the man with the least experience -- but his very, very widespread reputation is of being a smooth diplomat; an IOC problem solver, if you like; and a man widely credited with organizing the phenomenally successful Sydney, Australia, Games last year. Rogge has a great sporting background himself. He competed in the '68, '72, and '76 Olympic Games, as a sailor, and also played rugby for his country, and is today happy to share center stage with the outgoing president, Juan Antonio Samaranch -- and a really lovely touch when he presented Samaranch himself with an Olympic Gold Medal for his own achievements. Absolutely typical of the man -- smooth talking -- and a very, very popular decision. Now a word about the rivals he beat. Rogge in the second round of voting, he won. He totaled 59 votes. That was well clear of his closest rival, the South Korean politician Un-yong Kim, who got 23 votes. That's one clear of the Canadian lawyer, Dick Pound. So the new IOC president, the Belgian Jacques Rogge -- Colleen.\nMCEDWARDS: All right, thanks very much, Patrick.\nBRIAN NELSON, CNN ANCHOR: And our next guest is Melinda McKay. She's the senior vice president of a company called Jones Lang LaSalle. This is a firm that did an Olympic study on the long-term impact that cities who've received the Olympic Games are able to benefit from. And they've gone back and studied Sydney, Atlanta, Barcelona, and Seoul. So we now introduce Melinda McKay. Let's talk about Beijing. First of all, thank you for being with us, Ms. McKay. Why the study and who paid for it -- very quickly.\nMELINDA MCKAY, JONES LANG LASALLE: The study was done based on the fact that I was actually in Sydney last year, and I was seeing firsthand what was happening in the markets, the sort of infrastructure developments that were occurring and I thought it would be very interesting for our clients to actually take a look at what happened in past host cities and see if there were any consistencies across that.\nNELSON: Summarize what you found.\nMCKAY: We found that although there are certainly short-term economic gains to be had from the Olympics -- between $3 billion and $17 billion, depending on which of the past four host cities you look at. But really, the long-term legacy is in the change to the urban form of the city. At least the past four Olympic host cities have really used the Games to revitalize rundown urban areas.\nNELSON: All right and what would be the biggest example you'd like to point to?\nMCKAY: I would take the Sydney experience, because as I said before, I was seeing it first hand. They essentially turned the Olympic Village from a munitions dump -- it was an unusable industrial front -- into the world's most environmentally friendly suburb. And if you take the Atlanta example, they spent $1 billion on capital works as a result of the Games and have revitalized the downtown area.\nNELSON: In Atlanta, there was a change, in a sense, to the infrastructure around the Centennial Park, which was created to honor the Olympics. But by and large, some people may question whether all of this was worth the millions and millions -- or maybe I should say billions of dollars -- that are poured into getting the Olympic Games. Does it really balance out?\nMCKAY: I really do think it does, if you just take a pure look at the net economic gain that is measured from the Olympic Games -- and it, as I said before, ranges between $3 billion and $17 billion, and that's just the short-term gain; you've got the long-term changes to the urban form, which are just tremendous.\nNELSON: For residents of Beijing, if the city goes ahead and keeps its promises, what should residents be seeing by the year 2008 to their city?\nMCKAY: The Beijing of 2008 will definitely be significantly different from the city that we see now. Beijing is spending $12.2 billion on environmental improvements and antipollution measures. They're spending $3.7 billion on transport infrastructure. They are turning their Olympic Village -- the Olympic Green -- into a 200-acre park, and they're surrounding that by a nature park as well. So there are very exciting changes that we'll see for Beijing.\nNELSON: Thank you very much for taking the time to talk to us this morning, Melinda McKay, from Jones Lang LaSalle, and we appreciate your being here.\nMCKAY: Thank you.

Murray's been charged with involuntary manslaughter in the death of Michael Jackson. Jackson died of an overdose of the anesthesia Propofol and other drugs. To find out what affects these drugs had, I spoke to a doctor who saw Jackson's autopsy report. His name is Dr. Zeev Cain. He is the head of the Anesthesiology Department at the University of California, Irvine.\nLEMON: You saw the toxicology report?\nDR. ZEEV CAIN, DIRECTOR, ANESTHESIOLOGY DEPARTMENT, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, IRVINE: I saw the toxicology repot. I saw the autopsy report.\nLEMON: You did?\nCAIN: I did.\nLEMON: What was in Michael Jackson's system?\nCAIN: Several drugs, Midazolam, Diazepam, Lorazepam, Lidocaine, Epinephrine and Propofol.\nLEMON: That's a lot.\nCAIN: That's a lot of drugs. That's a lot of drugs.\nLEMON: Enough to kill someone?\nCAIN: Certainly enough to make sure that he stopped breathing, yes.\nLEMON: Yes. What did the autopsy report show?\nCAIN: Well, overall, Michael Jackson was actually in good health. There was no real problems in his internal organs. It did show, at some point in the past, he did use drugs but, again, overall, he was in excellent health.\nLEMON: What kind of drugs?\nCAIN: You can't really say that. The only thing we can do is go based on what we found in his blood.\nLEMON: OK. It didn't show one drug which the defense is saying he was addicted to. What I'm talking about,\nCAIN: Absolutely true. There was no Demerol found there, which means he did not really take Demerol for 40 days before this.\nLEMON: How many days would it have been in order for it to leave?\nCAIN: Several days. Demerol actually has a pretty long half life. So it stays in the system quite a while.\nLEMON: Yes. Were you surprised by anything in the report?\nCAIN: I would say I was surprised by what in good shape he was. Based on what I've heard previously, I expected to see more signs of chronic illness in his organs, more signs of an addict. They are not really there. He was basically healthy.\nLEMON: Yes. Yes. And to have those drugs, you said Lorazepam --\nCAIN: Diazepam, Midazolam.\nLEMON: All those drugs in there together -- does someone usually take all of those drugs together?\nCAIN: You take them if you want to induce sedation or medically induced coma. Which brings me to the issue of Propofol should not be used in home settings.\nLEMON: Yes.\nCAIN: It should be used when you want to medially induce coma or sedation in a hospital. You have to monitor somebody's blood pressure, heart rate, how well they are breathing. You have to monitor their oxygen level. That's the bottom line.\nLEMON: So, listen, people are -- this is going to be the issue now with medicine. How much can you get from doctors, depending on how much you pay? Your celebrity status? What you do for a living? All of that, is that at issue here?\nCAIN: Absolutely, it is. Remember, they found four gallons. Four gallons are enough to put to sleep about 500 people. Or it is enough to keep somebody asleep for eight hours for almost two months. Now, that may be a bit misleading, because he may have built resistance in his body already. We have to remember, when somebody does take Propofol on a regular basis, they will build up resistance. So I know some reports say it is a two-months supply. It depends how much resistance was in his body. It may only be a one week supply. We don't know.\nLEMON: Is there something we should be concerned about? I heard during the testimony that it is usually a doctor/patient relationship, and maybe this was an employee/employer relationship. Is that a concern to society overall in this case and in society, this culture where you see drugs on television and what have you?\nCAIN: To my opinion, there is a fundamental difference in the Western society versus other societies in the relations between doctor/patient. I think we need to go back to the basics and say doctors are here to take care of patients. It's not a question of you paying me for something. We are not the same as lawyers, to my opinion. We are doctors. Our first sworn duty is to take care of you. Money is secondary. We really need to take care your well being, regardless of how much you will pay for me.\nLEMON: Thank you, doctor.\nCAIN: You're welcome.\nLEMON: Dr. Zeev Cain.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "Donald Trump has made comments about women that have been criticized as inappropriate and offensive.", "reference_documents": ["JOHN KING, CNN HOST, “INSIDE POLITICS“: OK, it's an issue and it may be an issue in California, but for Jeb Bush to be stuck in the quick sand. I am convinced anchor baby could become the self- support of 2016. Once Mitt Romney went there in the campaign four years ago, it was over with Latino voters.\nASHLEY PARKER, “THE NEW YORK TIMES“: Right, I mean, it certainly was and here's the thing, Jeb Bush is a self-described policy wonk and a self-described nerd ball and so he wants to be talking about the policy and Trump has clearly gotten Jeb Bush and all the other Republicans off their game, and of course, this was some sort of make this about language and rhetoric. And when you're trying to substitute one group -- with another group, he is now offended, you're simply not winning regardless if you have very good policy that a lot of immigration activists agree with as Jeb does.\nKING: I think Mr. Trump is under the governor's skin, fair to say?\nROBERT COSTA, “THE WASHINGTON POST“: He is. I spoke to Trump yesterday. He just continues to slam Bush. And he loves it. I said are you going to stop it ever? He said, probably not and on immigration especially this has put the Republican Party in a tough position. The base loves what Trump is saying on immigration. Whether it plays in a general election, who knows?\nKING: Right, but the calendar has been changed, those southern states are going to be a lot more important this time.\nCOSTA: Even if you don't get a big bounce out of those early February caucuses and primaries, March 1st, nine states, south.\nKING: You mentioned he says he may not stop going after Governor Bush, someone needs to help me understand why he thinks it's in his benefit, to his benefit to keep going after Megyn Kelly. Megyn Kelly was on vacation. Donald Trump tweeting out last night at Megyn Kelly, “Must have had a terrible vacation. She is really off her game. Was afraid to confront Dr. Cornel West. No clue on immigration.“ That was about the “Kelly File“ last night. Later he tweets, “I like the “Kelly File“ much better without Megyn Kelly. Maybe she could take another 11-day unscheduled vacation“ so two sort of gratuitous shots at her there. What I think is a bigger problem. He then again re-tweeted a tweet where somebody called her a bimbo. He did that right after the Fox debate when he had the confrontation with her and he does it again last night. No rules apply to Donald Trump, but I cannot see how that is in his interest.\nPARKET: I was very stunned to see those tweets as well. Donald Trump is in a weird way a post Fox News candidate, a post everything candidate. The rules of traditional politics do not apply. You cannot go to war with Fox News. You try to get booked on all of their shows, right? And he's doing the exact opposite and crowd loves him for it.\nCOSTA: I was at a focus group last night of Trump supporters in Virginia and the one thing -- these were all Trump supporters, the one thing that really turned them off, Trump's comments about women. He should be paying attention to the voters. It's not acceptable if you're a presidential candidate.\nKING: Interesting point. We'll see how this plays out. Betsy Klein sent out a note saying she was talking to a Trump supporter who said, as a parent, it makes me cringe, some of the stuff he puts out on Twitter. Ashley, Robert, thanks for coming in. Alisyn, it's a very interesting. We'll see how the Jeb-Trump thing I think is going to be. We have that CNN debate coming up in just a few weeks. I think the Jeb-Trump thing is going to be the biggest head- butt.\nALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: The thing to watch. All right, we look forward to that debate, September 16th. John, thanks so much. Next, we speak exclusively with Christopher Norman. He is the man who helped those three Americans bring down a terror suspect in France. He tells us his incredible story on board that train.

As chair of the Energy Committee, this litigation is for the construction of the Denny substation, which is a very large Seattle City Light project in the middle of the Cascade neighborhood, the residential neighborhood and several low income housing buildings are immediately adjacent to the construction site, and substations usually don't go in such dense, densely populated areas. But this one is an exception. I do know that City Light has done a lot of outreach so far to the community and has found ways in which to mitigate the potential impact of the construction of this project on the neighbors.

Thank you very much. So to repeat again, the hearing is July 35, 30 PM at the Bell Town Community Center. Any other questions or comments? All in favor of adopting Resolution 31594 setting the public hearing vote. I oppose vote no. The resolution is unanimously adopted. Is there any other business? Councilmember Gardner, the Central Waterfront Committee will meet next. And beginning at what time?\nSpeaker 2: May I suggest that because of the very large number of citizens here in support of the resolution on the Vietnamese Heritage and Freedom flag, please can we plan 15 minutes between full council and the waterfront committee so that council members may briefly join the community in the birthday Atlantis room if they wish.

So thank you very much.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you. Any further comment? So none Mr. Wood here.\nSpeaker 0: Forgive me, but that sounds, in other case, like flies on garbage. It reminds me of what we went through a few years ago when Don I the last Mr. Dean had a property and the city were saying, this is here to auction piece of property that nobody wanted, nobody wanted. And of course, the dean bought it. And within before the ink was dry, before the ink was dry, made $1,000,000 in profit. And if that wasn't bad enough, if that wasn't bad enough, a few weeks later, somebody else said, Oh, that orphaned piece of property has a cousin. And another piece of property that nobody wanted, nobody wanted they sold. And don't quote the exact I think the price was somewhere between 9 to $0.11 an acre. That's almost as bad also as giving away the piece of property which the date is always memorialized in my room around the old hotel on a block from this convention center that nobody wanted and they gave it away for. I think it was a dollar. And that's easy to remember because that was the weekend of when Obama was in Cartagena and even the the ladies down there were holding out for their price.

And so looking at the alleyways, talking about doing the mural, the walkability there, connecting the promenade to areas that we typically don't think to connect to, including the arts, and also thinking creatively about our parking challenges that we have.

Authorize the sale of beer, wine and distilled spirits for consumption on the licensed premises. Among other things, the business met the Long Beach Municipal Code requirements to be eligible for a temporary entertainment permit and was issued one in November of 2021. All of the appropriate departments, Health and Human Services, Development Services, Police, Financial Management and Financial Management have reviewed the application and have provided their recommended conditions as contained in the hearing packet. The following recommended conditions on attachment A are of note from section two of the additional conditions. Section number one in that section is entertainment activities shall be restricted to no later than 11 p.m., Monday through Thursday and midnight Friday through Sunday. Entertainment can begin at 12 noon daily. The business applied, requesting entertainment to be permitted from nine or 10 a.m. to 2 a.m. seven days a week. And the Long Beach Police Department recommended the restricted conditions to balance community concerns and the businesses needs. Section number six or item number six. The committee has been requested to develop and maintain a plan to address neighborhood concerns related to the operation of the business. In addition, the Department of Financial Management is requesting a change to the enclosed conditions Section one. Item four, with the removal of the last sentence of the first paragraph. Hours of sales. Hours of sales of alcohol shall be limited to the hours when meals are available. In this particular situation, this condition was found to be too restricted after additional consideration of the communications from the business owner.

It's great ambiance and just a big upgrade on Fourth Street. So I support this entertainment permit.

Council members. So on.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Britain Brian. This council constable transfers of former substation property in the deluge neighborhood of Seattle from City Light to the Parks Department. Under state law, public utilities are financially distinct from the city, and so the property had to be sold at fair market value. In this case, the property was not part of Park's strategic plan, but the community wanted to maintain it as a greenspace. So the Delbridge Neighborhoods Development Association raised the money by winning grants to pay for it, and that menu is attached to the Council bill. I want to thank Dale Rich Neighborhoods Development Association for their work on behalf of their community and also thanks to City Light staff who as usual, have made sure to give the community the time they need to make the whole thing work. They went through a transparent process. My office also visited the property with the community members back in 2014, which is also a reflection of the careful way that City Light staff approached the disposition of property of this kind.

This project is in my district, District one. No, this is a project that our committee members have been working on for quite some time. I actually was on a community tour last week when this was being heard in committee. I want to thank the Parks Department for their funding contribution as well as King County for for theirs as well. The work that community members and our neighborhood district associations specifically I want to call out Willie Brown is fantastic in the vision for this property is really exciting as well. Not only will they be using the space for a natural wetland which will detail storm water runoff, alleviating flooding of neighborhood yards and driveways, but it will also provide a bio filtration of stormwater runoff before it enters Longfellow Creek. And then DDA will partner with Seattle Tilth and Nature Consortium and staff and students from Louisa Boren stem k through eight school to develop and manage the remaining part of the property as a permanent culture food forest. And this is really important for this community because Delbridge is a food desert. The land management system contains aspects of the native habitat with edible forest gardening and a children's garden will link classroom and field experience to educate local youth in environmental science and stewardship and atmosphere. So this is just a fantastic project.

We work to pass a fire code in conjunction with the building code to ensure consistency in development standards. The fire code was last updated in 2016 and it's usually updated every three years. Last year, both the building code and the fire code updates were delayed due to the public health emergency. Just highlighting the major changes in the fire code. There are four sort of categories of major, major changes. One relates to our allowing alternative fuel vehicles on display inside buildings to maintain their battery connection in order to keep their safety systems active. A second change relates to the need for integrated testing systems in high rise buildings to assure fire protection and life safety systems work together in an integrated way as intended and are tested at least every ten years. Third relates to a need for mobile fueling of vehicles to allow allow for mobile fueling of vehicles in designated areas such as parking lots and only those parking lots that meet certain requirements.

I will address that first and then see if any of you colleagues have comments to add. Council Bill 119794. As I discussed in this morning's council briefing is related to the Seattle Parking Enforcement Officers Guild's Collective Bargaining Agreement. This council bill would authorize the execution of a negotiated union contract between the city of Seattle and that bargaining unit. This is a three year contract from January 1st, 2019 through December 31st, 2021, and includes approximately 105 regularly appointed city employees in the Seattle Police Department. The financial terms of this union contract are similar to those of the State Coalition's union contracts and include a retroactive 4% annual wage increase for 2019 and a 3.6% annual wage increase for 2020. The financial and non-financial terms in this collective bargaining agreement were considered and approved by the members of the Labor Relations Policy Committee and are within those previously approved parameters. I'm happy to entertain any questions or hear any comments from any of my colleagues. Councilmember Peterson.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Council President Gonzalez, I appreciate.\nSpeaker 3: The hard work of our Labor Relations Policy Committee and the difficult decisions that you have to make.\nSpeaker 2: I do not serve on that particular committee of legislative and executive leaders who represent management and who negotiate the multitude of employment contracts.\nSpeaker 3: Impacting 12,000 city government workers.\nSpeaker 2: I carefully consider each contract on its own terms, and.\nSpeaker 3: At this moment in time, with the grim.\nSpeaker 2: Fiscal challenges our city.\nSpeaker 3: Government faces today, I'll be voting no on this particular contract for parking enforcement officers. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Peterson, for those remarks. Just really quickly, I want to be just responsive to the extent that I can. We don't need to belabor the point, but this this particular contract, and based on the evaluation given to us by the city Budget Office, does not have dire or detrimental impacts on the projected deficit of the city of Seattle. I think that I and the members of the Labor Relations Policy Committee, which include four other Council members and members of the executive team, carefully engaged with the city budget office to make sure that this was not only a high road employer contract, but also a contract that was fiscally responsible and within our existing means as a city and feel comfortable that the contract before us strikes the right balance and that in approving this contract, we will not be subjecting the city budget to to further pressure or crisis as a result of the the the contract. So I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting approval of this particular contract. Any other questions or comments, colleagues? Because remember Lewis.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much, Madam President. I do just want to signal that I will be voting in favor of ratifying this contract today. I think it's critical that as we go into what is going to be a very difficult a lot of very difficult conversations about the budget over the summer, in this fall, can we not lose sight of the fact that some of the most essential functions of government that we serve as a city are our first responders, law enforcement, firefighters, and certainly the employees that are included under this contract that provide an essential law enforcement based mechanism that is really essential to maintaining the social contract that holds the city of Seattle together . This these are some of the services that we need to fight more than ever to make sure that we are maintaining adequately and that these are workers, that we are seeking to have measures in place to retain and encourage them to stay in our workforce. There's never been a more appropriate time, I think, to ratify a contract like this for this group of workers. I hope it sets a precedent that we try to make sure that we set a budget that not only delivers essential services, but really defines our values as a progressive city. And I think it really starts by making sure that we boldly stand by some of the workers doing really essential and critical work out there. That hasn't abated during this crisis. So I will be voting in favor of this.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Lewis. Any other comments or questions on the bill? Hearing and seeing none. I would ask that the clerk please call the role on the passage of the bill.\nSpeaker 1: Lewis, I. Morales, I.

And it's going to be, what, 3 to 4 years before we're back up there. And it what sharpens. This is what happened on the blue line two days ago. Which was I? One of probably the worst experiences I've seen when the train left. PCH for Willow took about six and a half minutes and there was a very violent in terms of conduct and language mail attacking verbally and walking back and forth and threatening or using language, in your words. That has never crossed my lips or anybody I know of. And that continued on. And it's a matter of record. I've called the MTA, wrote rid of written a letter. It call also the police. Right then there was no police on the station at PCH, none at Pacific Coast Highway, none in Willow. When the train pulled into Willow, I walked up to knocked. I left one part of the car, walked up to the front, took the bike, walked up, knock on the door. The driver asked him to call the police and his response was and he had heard that and he said, well, he hasn't hurt her yet has he . So forth. And I suggest I told him to call the police. He would not. And I told and this is going to be your last day of work. If that if he didn't do that, that underscores the need of addressing the situation and taking the police that we. Are assigned to the police to the through line, which we don't have. They weren't there. And more often than not, not not there. Over and above the fact that transit policing is a specialized detail. And this council needs to step up to that fact and realize it and take the necessary steps to return the policing of the transit system to the trained professionals under Sheriff McDonnell.

It reminds me of what we went through a few years ago when Don I the last Mr. Dean had a property and the city were saying, this is here to auction piece of property that nobody wanted, nobody wanted. And of course, the dean bought it. And within before the ink was dry, before the ink was dry, made $1,000,000 in profit. And if that wasn't bad enough, if that wasn't bad enough, a few weeks later, somebody else said, Oh, that orphaned piece of property has a cousin. And another piece of property that nobody wanted, nobody wanted they sold. And don't quote the exact I think the price was somewhere between 9 to $0.11 an acre. That's almost as bad also as giving away the piece of property which the date is always memorialized in my room around the old hotel on a block from this convention center that nobody wanted and they gave it away for. I think it was a dollar. And that's easy to remember because that was the weekend of when Obama was in Cartagena and even the the ladies down there were holding out for their price.

They felt a long basis for police to come so forth. Thank you.\nSpeaker 7: There's a motion in a second, Councilmember Pearce.\nSpeaker 3: Yes, I did want to just take a little the opportunity that I didn't take previously to say when I met with Raintree, I just really was excited about thinking outside of the box and going above and beyond what's required in a project like this.

National Teen Dating, Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month is an effort to raise awareness about abuse in teen relationships and promote programs that prevent it during the month of February. Unfortunately, dating violence among teens is more common than most people know, according to a recent all national recent national survey. One in ten teens reported being hit or physically hurt, hurt by purpose or hurt on purpose by a boyfriend or girlfriend once in the last 12 months. In addition, one in four teenagers have been in a relationship where a partner is verbally abusive. By supporting the National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month, that's that's a mouthful. We as a city can bring awareness to the issue on a local level and demonstrate our commitment to fostering and supporting a healthier community for all. And we're going to hear during public comment from Candi Lewis, executive director of the Positive Results Corporation. Ms.. Lewis will share with us what her organization is doing to help address teen teen dating violence and how we can support their efforts. And with that, I'll move to move the item.\nSpeaker 1: It's a motion in a second, Councilwoman Gonzalez.\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Thank you, Councilmember Richardson, for bringing this forward. I think it's really important we make sure that we're talking about teen dating violence, both traditional and also via social media and other formats. It's really important. Our teens are certainly the future, and we want to make sure that, you know, that this council is very supportive of of what you're doing. And hopefully, if you are going through anything, you can seek support. But I look forward to hearing from the public and hearing a little bit more about about this issue. But let's stay on this. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Any public comment on the item? Seeing nonmembers, please cast your votes. I didn't see over there.\nSpeaker 9: I.\nSpeaker 1: Let's let's let that lady make a few comments.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mayor Garcia, Councilmember Richardson and the esteemed council members. My name is Candy Lewis, and I am the executive director of the Positive Results Corporation. We are a nonprofit, and our mission is to address teen dating violence and sexual assault in youth and communities of color. Teen dating violence is an epidemic. And the numbers that you've heard are just reported. The reported numbers are dismal, but the actual numbers are even worse right now. 90 every 90 seconds, a girl in the United States is assaulted. But that's only reported. That's a girl this over 12 years old. And so we're not really showing those correct numbers, according to our surveys that we have personally done in the last five years. We've had over 2200 people that we've surveyed. 37% were African-American. 43% were Latino, Latina, 9% white, 5% Asian, 33%. Pacific Islander, two Middle Eastern, 2%. Middle Eastern. 48% of youth and young adults have experienced sexual assault, dating and domestic violence by the sixth grade. 60.3% of youth and young adults report being hit, slapped, grabbed, pinch, spit, act, and over 60% didn't realize that they could be in a dating and domestic violence relationship. Teen dating violence looks like physical assault, verbal abuse, emotional mental, physical stalking and of course, cyber. And we thank you very much for bringing this to your to the city's attention. It is a national resolution. And because of your support, we'll be able to bring local work, a local commitment here into the city of Long Beach. There's a lot of work that's already being done, but it's not nearly enough because all of our children are impacted. Violence and abuse actually starts in the womb, and if we do not address it, we are going to have a worse problem. Right now, the numbers are 36% of every pregnant woman is physically assaulted. 36%. If we were to turn around and look at the audience and ask them, how many of you have experienced teen dating violence , domestic violence or sexual assault? I'm sure almost everyone would be because every one of us is impacted by it. If it's not in our family, it is in our neighbors, it's in our children. And so I thank you very much for bringing this to light. We do have additional information that we will be happy to share with you. I also have something for you all. I brought our brochure that talks about the work that we do. We not only address teen dating violence and sexual assault, but we also address bullying healthy relationships. Because if we do not talk about healthy relationships, we won't be talking about any relationships as well. And our organization has been partner with all state foundation to eliminate teen dating violence and sexual assault. And so I have a little something for everyone.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, ma'am.

You may remember that you voted last year to approve the Denver preschool tax for another decade, I believe.

And in this case, we I think I'm looking at David, I think we got it right on the sales tax amount, but we were a little low in what the city would take in overall. And so what that means is we need your permission again, because we told you what we thought we were going to take in. We hope that you will tell us again that we should keep the money that we collected for the preschool and use it to get kids head start in life and get them learning their ABCs and safe and quality child care during their start before school.

Dignity Health, one of the nation's largest healthcare systems, is seeking to form a new partnership to expand its occupational medicine and urgent care offerings. The San Francisco-based provider and Select Medical Holdings Corp. announced on Monday that they had signed a definitive agreement to combine Concentra Group Holdings LLC, an occupational medicine and urgent care service provider, with U.S. HealthWorks, a subsidiary of Dignity Health Holdings Company, which provides similar services. The companies said in the announcement that the partnership aims to strengthen the delivery of care through greater access and standardization of best practices improving health and wellness services for employers and employees. ## Whitepaper ### Elevate Health Plan Member Engagement Through Call Center Transformation Learn how health plans can rapidly transform their call center operations and provide high-touch, concierge service to health plan members. The deal is still subject to closing conditions, but the announcement said it will occur through an equity purchase and contribution agreement that will allow Concentra to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of U.S. HealthWorks from Dignity Health Holdings. The transaction is targeted to close in the first quarter of 2018. Once finalized, Dignity Health will own a 20% equity interest in the combined entity holding Concentra and U.S. HealthWorks, an occupational healthcare center operator with 250 medical and onsite clinics in 21 states. RELATED: Urgent care centers help Dignity Health boost patient access, better manage population health in Bay Area This is not the first joint venture of Select Medical and Dignity Health. Earlier this year they worked together to construct and operate a 60-bed acute inpatient rehabilitation hospital in the greater Las Vegas metro area. That facility is expected to open in 2019. The agreement also includes joint operation of 12 outpatient rehabilitation clinics in the Las Vegas area. This new partnership will expand upon the relationship. Robert Ortenzio, executive chairman and co-founder of Select Medical, said that the latest deal will allow the organizations to join forces to \"deliver best-in-class occupational medicine and urgent care to communities and corporate work sites nationwide.\" Daniel Morissette, senior executive vice president and chief financial officer at Dignity Health, said in the announcement that the partnership will \"strengthen the delivery of clinical care, standardize best practices and improve service for employers and employees.\" RELATED: AHA: 6 ways hospitals can improve care access The transaction values U.S. HealthWorks at $753 million.

Concentra will also redeem certain of its outstanding equity interests from the existing minority equity holders, and Select Medical will retain a majority voting interest in the combined entity following the closing of the transaction. Dignity Health operates more than 400 care centers, including hospitals, urgent and occupational care, imaging and surgery centers, home health and primary care clinics in 22 states, with a network of more than 9,000 physicians and 63,000 employees.

Now Politics Business Nation Entertainment Opinion Food Sports World Obituaries Real Estate California Living Technology Science Travel Visuals L.A. Times en Español E-Newspaper Design LA Extras Shop About Advertisement # Jackson Ends World Tour, Cites Painkiller Addiction Entertainer Michael Jackson abruptly canceled the remaining dates of his world tour Friday, announcing that \"horrifying\" allegations of child molestation have caused him to become addicted to painkillers and have left him \"physically and emotionally exhausted.\" Jackson, who was scheduled to perform in Puerto Rico on Sunday, instead flew to Switzerland with his longtime friend Elizabeth Taylor and her husband, Larry Fortensky, sources close to Jackson said. In an audiotape released late Friday by his publicist, Jackson said he began using painkillers seven months ago after he underwent reconstructive surgery for a scalp burn suffered during the filming of a Pepsi commercial in 1984. \"The medications were used sparingly at first,\" Jackson said, but increased after the child molestation allegations were leveled against him in August. \"As I left on this tour, I had been the target of an extortion attempt, and shortly thereafter was accused of horrifying and outrageous conduct,\" Jackson said. \"I was humiliated, embarrassed, hurt and suffering great pain in my heart. The pressure resulting from these false allegations coupled with the incredible energy necessary for me to perform caused so much distress that it left me physically and emotionally exhausted. I became increasingly more dependent on the painkillers to get me through the days of the tour.\" The tape-recorded comments marked the first time that Jackson has directly addressed the allegations that he sexually molested a 13-old-boy over a period of months earlier this year. Those allegations surfaced after the boy told his therapist that Jackson had first befriended him and had then become increasingly intimate--sharing his bed, fondling him and masturbating him, among other things. The therapist reported those allegations to authorities Aug. 17, and the Los Angeles Police Department launched a criminal investigation the next day. The 13-year-old subsequently filed a lawsuit against the pop superstar. In his statement, Jackson did not indicate whether he had plans to return to this country. The lawyer for the alleged victim said he hoped that Jackson would come back so that the boy's lawsuit could be heard in court. \"If Michael Jackson is canceling his tour, it would be my hope that he would return to Los Angeles and allow us to try this case in court in an expeditious manner rather than running away from this matter,\" attorney Larry R. Feldman said Friday prior to Jackson's announcement. \"I think my client has a right to move forward with this.\" On the tape, Jackson thanked Taylor, who herself has struggled with drug dependency, for her \"unconditional love.\" He credited the actress with giving him important support, encouragement and counsel. \"My friends and doctors advised me to seek professional guidance immediately in order to eliminate what has become an addiction,\" Jackson said. \"It is time for me to acknowledge my need for treatment in order to regain my health. I realize that completing the tour is no longer possible and I must cancel the remaining dates. I know I can overcome the problem and will be stronger from the experience.\" The sudden cancellation of Jackson's heralded \"Dangerous World Tour\" appeared to catch many of his associates by surprise, stirring intense confusion in his far-flung entourage throughout the day Friday. As late as Friday afternoon, a spokesman for Pepsi-Cola, which is sponsoring the tour, said he had no information indicating that any dates were being canceled. In Mexico, members of Jackson's contingent said they were awaiting word on the status of the tour, while in Puerto Rico, the promoter said he expected those shows to go on. Then, without explanation, the same promoter announced early Friday evening that they had been canceled. Sources said members of the Jackson camp expect to hold a news conference in Los Angeles on Monday to make an announcement regarding the entertainer. In the meantime, neither Jackson's criminal attorney, Howard Weitzman, nor his civil lawyer, Bertram Fields, was available to answer questions. Jackson's private investigator, Anthony J. Pellicano, refused to comment. Jackson was booked to perform at least eight more shows before the end of the year in Jakarta, Indonesia; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Dubai; New Delhi; Singapore, and Puerto Rico. Other shows, including one next week in Monterrey, Mexico, also were being added to the schedule. Citing illness and scheduling complications, Jackson had already canceled almost a third of the 30 stops on the tour, which opened Aug. 24 in Bangkok. Jackson also is scheduled to appear at a \"Jackson Family Honors\" event Dec. 11 in Atlantic City. Sources close to Jackson said that now appears unlikely. The criminal investigation of the internationally renowned singer and composer has not concluded. This week, police served their fourth search warrant, this time at the Encino home of Jackson's parents. Investigators left with boxes of material, including photographs, but authorities would not comment on what was seized. A source familiar with the investigation said that among other things, they were searching for information to corroborate interviews that police have conducted with former Jackson employees. Previous searches have taken investigators to two of Jackson's homes and to a hotel suite that he often uses in Las Vegas. Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said this week that police had not concluded their investigation. A well-placed law enforcement source said it will not be wrapped up until early next year. Meanwhile, Feldman, the lawyer for the 13-year-old boy who filed suit against Jackson, is pushing for speedy progress on the case. Feldman has asked Jackson to submit a sworn deposition, but Jackson's lawyers have not agreed to make him available. Instead, they have asked that the civil case be put on hold for as long as six years or until the criminal case is concluded--a request that a Superior Court judge is scheduled to consider Nov. 23. If granted, the delay would effectively prevent any information obtained during the preparation of the lawsuit from being used in any criminal probe. Despite the international uproar created when the allegations of child molestation became public in August, Jackson had pressed on with his world tour, performing across Asia and Europe in recent months despite setbacks and distractions. At the tour's outset, as the allegations surfaced, Jackson canceled two Bangkok shows, citing dehydration. He shelved a date in Singapore after collapsing backstage. Other shows were canceled in South Africa, Australia, Chile and Peru. The end of the tour Friday could mean the end of Jackson's decade-long relationship with Pepsi-Cola. The company's sponsorship of Jackson extends only through the current tour. Over the 10 years Pepsi has featured Jackson in its advertising, the company has gained two market share points on rival Coke. Each point is worth an estimated $500 million in annual sales. But it is difficult to isolate Jackson's appeal from that of scores of other celebrities and promotions that have also been linked with Pepsi during that time. While Pepsi has enriched Jackson with an estimated $20 million in endorsement fees, marketing and corporate image experts generally say that if Pepsi's relationship with Jackson ends, it will likely have no effect on Pepsi sales. And Pepsi's corporate image will probably be tarnished for only a very brief time. \"Pepsi has an extremely loyal consumer following,\" said Kristine Kelley, managing editor of Beverage Industry, a Northbrook, Ill.-based trade magazine. \"They are not really swayed by who endorses the product.\" Contributing to this story were Times staff writer Bruce Horovitz in Los Angeles and researcher Susan Drummet in Mexico City.

(Photo: John T. Greilick, The Detroit News) Washington — A new bill that aims to mandate background checks for nearly all commercial and private firearm purchases has bipartisan support within Michigan's congressional delegation. The legislation introduced in Congress this month would close a loophole that allows people buying firearms through private sales, such as those at gun shows and online, to skip background checks. Sponsors say the goal is to prevent sales to felons, domestic abusers and people with mental-health issues that would disqualify themfrom gun ownership. With a few exceptions, anyone who isn't a licensed dealer would not be able to transfer firearms under the bill to ensure sales are run through the national criminal background check system. U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, R-St. Joseph (Photo: Susan Walsh / AP) Republican Rep. Fred Upton, Michigan's senior member in the U.S. House, is an original co-sponsor of the bill. \"This doesn't take away the legitimate rights of folks who want to own firearms,\" Upton said. \"Background checks are something I've always supported, and I think it closes some loopholes that got to be pretty glaring.\" The southwest Michigan Republican recalled attending two Ducks Unlimited dinners last year where organizers raffled off shotguns. Each winner had to undergo a background check before claiming the prize, he noted. \"If it can work at a setup like that, it should work at a gun show,\" Upton said. \"We have the technology today we didn't have before, so let's use it and let's deny folks that have a criminal background from being able to at least legally being able to get some of these weapons.\" The legislation has 225 co-sponsors in the Democratic-controlled House, including six Michigan Democrats. Buy Photo U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Tipton (Photo: Dale G. Young, The Detroit News) Michigan's seventh Democrat, Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Holly, hasn't co-sponsored the measure but \"definitely\" supports it, she said. \"The Second Amendment and issues related to gun safety are very sensitive and polarizing but, wherever I went in my district, the common ground we always had was that if you want to buy a weapon, you should have to go through a standard background check,\" the freshman lawmaker said. Slotkin — who carried a Glock 17 and an M4 semi-automatic weapon while deployed in Iraq — noted members of the military and Central Intelligence Agency must undergo the same background checks before weapons training. Michigan Sens. Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, both Democrats, have sponsored a companion bill in the Senate, where the legislation is expected to face resistance from GOP lawmakers. The National Rifle Association opposes the legislation, as it has similar measures in the past. \"So-called universal background checks will never be universal because criminals do not comply with the law,\" NRA spokeswoman Amy Hunter said by email. \"Instead of looking for effective solutions that will deal with the root cause of violent crime and save lives, anti-gun politicians would rather score political points and push ineffective legislation that doesn't stop criminals from committing crimes.\" GOP Rep. Tim Walberg of Tipton also will not support the bill, describing it as \"more gun control.\" \"While we have a shared desire of preventing acts of violence and protecting our communities, there are better approaches that respect the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens,\" Walberg said in a statement. U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Dearborn (Photo: David Guralnick / Detroit News) \"Our solutions should center around improving mental health care, addressing the underlying causes of violence and strengthening enforcement of existing laws.\" Critics of the legislation noted that suspects in several mass shootings had cleared background checks, including the alleged shooter who last February killed 17 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. \"You have to start someplace,\" said Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Dearborn. \"If we can keep guns out of one person's hands who shouldn't have them, we should be doing it.\" Upton noted the bill exempts private firearm transfers between certain family members. Those include loans or gifts between spouses, immediate family members, aunts or uncles and their nieces or nephews, and grandparents or grandchildren, according to the bill text. Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Rochester Hills (Photo: Clarence Tabb Jr., Detroit News) The legislation also exempts transfers between law enforcement officers and military personnel acting in their official capacities, as well as transfers to executors of estates, and \"temporary\" transfers for hunting or \"to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm.\" Narrowing the bill to just deal with background checks increases its chances of making it into law, said Rep. Dan Kildee of Flint Township, who is chief deputy whip for House Democrats. \"Potentially, the kind of numbers that we get when we go to the floor could be big enough that it forces the president's hand, if we can get it through the Senate,\" Kildee said. House Democrats said introducing the bill in the first weeks of the new Congress demonstrates their commitment to acting on gun reform. On her first day in office, freshman Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Rochester Hills, sent a letter to colleagues saying reducing gun violence would be a top priority.

Positioning as \"Long Island's Real Mix of Classic Hits\", the station is focusing on hits of the 1970s through 90s with an emphasis on the 1980s. The first songs played were Van Halen's \"Jump\", Huey Lewis & The News \"Heart of Rock and Roll\", J Geils Band \"Centerfold\", and Spin Doctors \"Two Princes\". Listen to the launch of Real-FM at FormatChange.com. Original Report 4/17: After running a placeholder music format since New Year's Day, VMT Media's 107.1 WLIR-FM Hampton Bays and 96.9 W245BA Manorville NY will debut its new format on Friday, April 20 at 11:45am. VMT Media purchased Richard Anderson's Holding Out Hope Church's 51% share of the station last May for assumption of debt and a three year non-compete agreement that started on January 1. AJ Sonnick will serve as Director of Operations and Marketing for WLIR-FM. The World Famous WLIR-FM broadcasting on 107.1 and 96.9 to Long Islanders, and online at wlir.com, has been stunting since before the new year. This Friday, April 20th, at 11:45AM, the station encourages everyone to tune in as they will end the \"wheel of formats\" and debut a new format. Station management has been stunting, playing anything and everything, using the tagline, \"something real is coming to this frequency\", for several months. With the release of the most recent documentary, it shows how important the WLIR call letters are and how important the history is to many people. The station owners want to keep the integrity, pride, and trust of those who have cared for the WLIR call letters over its 59 year history and expand its reach unlike ever before. WLIR-FM will certainly be something exciting and real again as of April 20th. With a population of over 1 million people, the East-End will have something new to listen to. This is momentous because of WLIR's long history. Making its debut in 1959, WLIR has gone through several owners, formats, many changes and a long battle with the FCC. Famously known for discovering artists such as Prince and Depeche Mode who were not played on the airwaves before, WLIR has been a big part of radio history and an even bigger part of the lives of many Long Islanders.

{"topic": "aggrefact", "statement": "Off-price retailers buy overproduced or unsold goods, showroom remnants of collections from their respective brand owners or brand stores and distributing networks under certain terms and conditions in order to offer them to their final consumer with the lowest possible markup", "reference_documents": ["TITLE: Off-price Retailers: What Wholesalers Need to Know | Handshake Read more blog posts fromSales # Off-price Retailers: What Wholesalers Need to Know BySarah Leung|October 7, 2015 For wholesale businesses in the fashion and soft goods industries, selling to off-price retailers represents a compelling strategy for insulating your business against demand unpredictability. Off-price retailers are retailers that take advantage of overruns, inventory forecasting mistakes, and cancelled orders in order to sell brand-name merchandise at a significant discount. Off-price retail has been booming over the last few years as the United States has dealt with recession and recovery. Indeed, off-price retailers have several advantages during uncertain economic climates. As a lower price option to obtain higher value goods, consumers often turn to these stores when budgets are tight. Off-price retailers themselves also benefit from poor economic conditions because they are able to take advantage of greater excess inventory to bring in higher quality goods at lower prices. Some of the biggest off-price retailers include TJX (TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods stores), Ross Stores, Burlington Coat Factory, Big Lots, Filene's Basement and DSW (Designer Shoe Warehouse) in the brick and mortar space, as well as Overstock.com and Bluefly.com in the online space. You might expect that as the economy recovers, the off-price retail market wouldn't be looking as promising. However, credit rating agency Moody projects that the three biggest off-price retailers – TJX, Ross and Burlington – should see between 6 and 8 percent growth over the next five years, compared to only 4 percent growth for the retail industry as a whole. With those kinds of numbers, it's definitely worth taking a closer look. ## Why off-price retailers? The off-price retail space is expected to continue to outpace the rest of the retail space for the foreseeable future. In fact, despite off-price retailers' rather underwhelming online presence, they are the fastest growing segment in retail today. A few of the factors contributing to off-price retail's continued success include: 1. Consumers continue to be conservative with their dollars. Despite a somewhat rosier economic outlook these days, consumers are continuing to keep a close eye on discretionary spending. Off-price retail stores are popular because their costs are low, and they are able to offer discounts of 20 to 60%. 2. Off-price retailers have a different purchasing strategy. Off-price stores are opportunistic in their purchasing strategy – TJX, for instance, works with more than 16,000 sources and is able to cherry pick the best offerings from wholesalers and manufacturers that need to clear excess inventory or unpopular items. 3. Off-price retailers move inventory more quickly. This is a big part of why the off-price retail business model works. Off-price retailers don't have high margins, so they have to make it up on volume. This means that their buyers are constantly in the market for the latest trends and greatest deals. Off-price retailers buy up to 40 times a year, compared to 4 times a year for full price retailers. Ultimately, the secret to off-price retailers' success isn't a secret at all – it's low cost / high volume. Unlike full price retail that relies on fashion trends and changing design to drive demand and profits, off-price retail relies on low cost to move a high volume of goods quickly. It does this by leveraging its relationships with designers, wholesalers and manufacturers with excess inventory. ## A Symbiotic Relationship Retail is a tricky business – consumers are finicky and even the best designers and retail professionals make mistakes sometimes about trends, colors and other design aspects, or miscalculate demand for a particular item. In these cases, having an established relationship with an off-price retailer offers companies the opportunity to salvage some, if not all, of their manufacturing costs and even to profit – even if the margins are lower than they would have been in full-price retail. ## Finding Off-price Buyers Regardless of the reason, if you're looking to move inventory quickly and you've established that off-price retailers are the way to do that, the next question is how to find those off-price retailers that would be good buyers for your brand. Here are a few ways to get started: ### 1. Trade Shows: Off-price retail buyers attend the usual trade shows for fashion and soft goods, and also have a few of their own. The Off-Price Shows in New York and Las Vegas are two to consider. ### 2. Year Round Off-price Markets and Showrooms: Just as cities like Dallas, Atlanta and Los Angeles have wholesale markets and showrooms where full price wholesalers and retail buyers can meet, some also have off-price markets, such as the Los Angeles Off-price Market. Los Angeles is a center for the off-price retail market, with several blocks of year-round off-price markets in downtown LA near Santee Alley. ### 3. Full Price Markets and Trade Shows: Buyers in the off-price retailing trade are always buying, 40 weeks a year as opposed to only four times a year for most full price retailers. That means they are always on the hunt and do attend larger trade shows. Off-price retail looks to be popular with consumers for the foreseeable future, and provides a needed service to the wholesale industry. Establishing relationships with buyers in the off-price retailing market can be a great way for fashion and soft goods wholesalers to insulate against the ups and downs of supply and demand.

Sign InSubscribe # Popular Metaphysics Richard Corliss Sunday, Apr. 11, 1999 Follow @TIME Bunch of guys at a Manhattan 'plex watching The Matrix. Carrie-Anne Moss kicks some 'droid butt, makes a streetwide leap from one building top to the next, then crash lands through a small window. \"The bitch is bad,\" one of the guys opines. \"Go, girl!\" Then Laurence Fishburne shows up as Morpheus--a morphing Orpheus, a black White Rabbit, an R.-and-B. Obi-Wan Kenobe, a big bad John the Baptist, a Gandalf who grooves; every wise guide from literature, religion, movies and comix. Though he's in a dark room in the dead of night, and as if he needed to be more cool, Fishburne is wearing these teeny black shades. Another guy at the 'plex says approvingly, \"Those glasses are fabulous!\" To deliver a futurismo fashion statement and a can of whup-ass in the same movie--this is smart filmmaking. Larry and Andy Wachowski, the Chicago-bred brothers who wrote and directed The Matrix, are smart in a way moviegoers love and Hollywood moguls cherish: the picture, shot in Australia for $63 million, had the year's strongest opening weekend and pulled in a robust $50.7 million in its first nine days. The film's producer, Joel Silver, says the boys have a sequel in mind, and cannily adds, \"The more success the movie has, the more willing they'll be to write it down.\" Suddenly Larry, 33, and Andy, 31, are giving Peter and Bobby Farrelly (There's Something About Mary) competition as the hottest brother act in town. But the Wachowskis, whose first directorial effort was the seductive femme-noir drama Bound, have deeper fish to fry. \"We're interested in mythology, theology and, to a certain extent, higher-level mathematics,\" says Larry. \"All are ways human beings try to answer bigger questions, as well as The Big Question. If you're going to do epic stories, you should concern yourself with those issues. People might not understand all the allusions in the movie, but they understand the important ideas. We wanted to make people think, engage their minds a bit.\" And blow their minds a lot. The film posits that life as we know it is a computer simulation: it is, Morpheus says, \"the world that has been pulled over your eyes\" by some creepezoid machines that look like spidery octopi. Who can free a mankind that doesn't know it's enslaved? Morpheus believes the cybermessiah is Neo (Keanu Reeves), a computer hacker. Early in the film Morpheus offers two pills to Neo. Take the blue one, you wake up and remember nothing. Take the red pill, \"you stay in Wonderland. And I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.\" Naive viewers may think The Matrix is just a cool way to pass the time while sitting in the Phantom Menace waiting room. They should think again, breathe deep, get strapped in for a brain-popping trip. The Matrix is a careering cyberride without the headset, a virtual masterpiece. Every other movie out there is the blue pill. This one is the red. An anthology of dystopic science fiction, The Matrix plunders Blade Runner and The Terminator: bad machines, grungy rebels and rain, rain everywhere, even indoors. It invokes the kung furiosity of prime Jackie Chan and the heroic bloodshed and long coats of John Woo movies; the Hollywood-Hong Konglomeration has never meshed so suavely as in this film's fight scenes and wire-work aerobatics. Never seen the mega-imaginative, ultraviolent Japanese cartoons known as anime (Akira, Ghost in the Shell)? Now you have--in whirling live action. Those are just the movie references. The Wachowskis, both dropouts from good colleges (Larry from Bard, Andy from Emerson), want to weld classic lit, hallucinogenic imagery and a wild world of philosophical surmises to pop culture. The Bible meets Batman; Lewis Carroll collides with William Gibson; Greek and geek mythology bump and run. Hell, you may find string theory in The Matrix. As the children of a businessman and a nurse, the boys created comic books, and the obsession continued into their 20s. \"Jack Kirby comics interested us,\" says Andy. \"We liked the idea of punching guys through brick walls and over-the-top action like that.\" But they connected as well with older, more revered sources. \"The Bible seeks to answer a lot of relevant questions for man,\" says Larry. \"In the film we refer to the story of Nebuchadnezzar; he has a dream he can't remember but keeps searching for an answer. Then there's the whole idea of a messiah. It's not just a Judeo-Christian myth; it also plays into the search for the reincarnation of the Buddha.\" The search--the quest--informs Greek myths (\"We have Orpheus and Morpheus in the film,\" says Larry) as well as Alice's Adventures in Wonderland: \"It's a story about consciousness,\" says Larry, \"a child's perception of an adult's world. The Matrix is about the birth and evolution of consciousness. It starts off crazy, then things start to make sense.\" It can also be read as a variant on Gibson's Neuromancer, the 1986 cyberpunk classic about a computer cowboy on the run. \"It'd be near impossible to make a movie out of that,\" says Larry. \"We knew the way to make it relevant was to turn what we view as the real world into a virtual reality.\" Previous Page Next Page  TITLE: ONLINE CHAT - Larry & Andy Wachowski 92 captures 31 Mar 2001 - 11 May 2022 About this capture COLLECTED BY Organization: Alexa Crawls Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Those with the DVD, and a DVD-ROM player, were able to watch the movie along with the directors. This allowed Larry and Andy to comment on specific scenes while people asked their questions Those without a DVD-ROM were, of course, also able to participate. For this transcript, we've included a short description of what was being viewed during the chat. Larry and Andy had a great time. Their only misgiving was not having adequate time in the chat environment to answer questions more fully. They want to fix that. We're going to set up a specific place here at the site where people can post questions to the Brothers. This is a direct result of everyone involved asking such great questions. We'll have news of how we're going to set this up here and on the front page, shortly. ILoveNatPortman: Can you give any information on the sequels, or even confirm their existence? WachowskiBros: Yes, we are working on them right now. Well, we would be working on them right now except we have to be here in the chat room, LOL. blindrocket: Do you practice Martial Arts? WachowskiBros: No, we do not, but we watch a lot of Kung Fu movies. AgentMartin: Why didn't you both do the commentary on the DVD, time restraints? WachowskiBros: That's a two part answer. Part one is that we believe that film is a collaborative media, that's why we never take a film by credit. We think the other artists who help create a film are important and interesting, and for people who want to understand the process of filmmaking And the second part is, that we were too tired. Hiryu: Which Anime inspired you the most and why? WachowskiBros: We liked Ghost in the Shell and the Ninja Scroll and Akira. In anime, one thing they do that we tried to bring to our film was a juxtaposition of time and space in action beats AgentMartin: Is there anything in The Matrix which you weren't too happy with, wished you could have done differently? WachowskiBros: That would require the rest of the chat to answer! But, we'll answer that in general we're fairly happy with the way it turned out. blindrocket: Would you consider yourselves computer nerds? WachowskiBros: You got the second part right, just nerds! LOL. AgentMartin: Were you excited about DVD as a medium for your movies to go to the homes of the masses? WachowskiBros: As a technology, DVD is exciting medium. But like all technologies, it still needs to be developed by the users of the technology. Enigma: What is the role or faith in the movie? Faith in oneself first and foremost - or in something else? WachowskiBros: Hmmmm..... that is a tough question! Faith in one's self, how's that for an answer? Peter: Will there be a directors cut of the matrix with any deleted scenes or out takes? WachowskiBros: Nope, nope! Because we were pretty happy with the way it turned out. AgentMartin: The two of you seemed to have a great relationship together for the making of this movie. Have you always been very close? WachowskiBros: We just met actually. Tonight! Sentinel: What comic books inspired the look of the Matrix? WachowskiBros: The largest influence from the comic book world on the actual design would be the art of Geof Darrow. Revenge: What did the humans do to scortch the sky?? WachowskiBros: We'll answer that question later. larrikin: How long did it take to film in Sydney Was the entire movie shot in Sydney? WachowskiBros: 118 days, and yes. On DVD, Neo is talking to Morpheus via cell phone, climbing out the window of the Meta Cortechs office. This is actually Keanu Reeves getting out onto a ledge, without a stuntman. He does this entire scene without a stuntman, and it's 34 floors up. hokeyboy: Were the filmmakers influenced by Alex Proyas's similarly themed \"Dark City\"? WachowskiBros: No, but we thought it was very strange that Australia came to have three films associated with it that with it that were all about the nature of reality. Dark City, The Truman Show and The Matrix.. Enjoythesilence: How would you say Bound and the Matrix are similar? WachowskiBros: Both films examine the idea of an individual searching for their true self while attempting to escape the box that we often make of our lives. calla: What do the time 9:18 and the date 9/18 signify? Is this a personal reference? WachowskiBros: That's my wife's birthday. Inge: How long did the lobby scene take to shoot? WachowskiBros: It took 12 days to shoot the lobby scene. Inge: Which scene are you guys most happy with? Which is your favorite? For me it was Neo on his way to Morpheus the first time. WachowskiBros: If you're talking about the pill scene, that's our favorite too. Sealouse: Why was it filmed in Australia? WachowskiBros: Costs. calla: There are quite a few hidden messages in the movie that I notice the more I watch it. Can you tell me about how many there are? WachowskiBros: There are more than you'll ever know. Inge: Did you guys take a nice holiday after the film opened? You deserved it! WachowskiBros: Thank you very much! And we did. Sentinel: What do you think of the fans of the Matrix?? WachowskiBros: We love them. ToiletCommando: Are you prepared to become legends? WachowskiBros: Legends of what? MadMatt: You guys BIG Jackie Chan fans?? WachowskiBros: Yes, we love a lot of Hong Kong cinema Jackie Chan in Drunken Master II is fantastic.. TheTrinityACMXCL: What about the animals in the Matrix? Are they real animals or just computer-generated images? WachowskiBros: Sadly, they are all computer generated images. ToiletCommando: Is it true that you got some of your ideas from the Vertigo comic The Invisibles? WachowskiBros: We do enjoy that comic, but no. ThedrickFel: What exactly was the mirror made of? Was it the same stuff they injected into Morpheus? Why silver? WachowskiBros: The mirror is actually a mirror. When Neo sees it, it's a hallucination, but it's the direct result of the pill Morpheus has given Neo. Reflections in general are a significant theme in the film. The ideas of worlds within worlds.. AgentMartin: Are you suprised by the amount of internet life that The Matrix has spawned, fan sites etc? WachowskiBros: Surprised? Yes, very, very surprised. We are completely stupefied by the fan response to the film. On DVD, Morpheus offers Neo a choice... WachowskiBros: The idea of the reflection, the two Neos in Morpheus' glasses, is that this represents the two lives Neo is leading. In the left lens, we see the blue pill and Thomas Anderson, and in the right lens, we see the red pill and Neo. Jose: What kind of drug does the red pill contain? WachowskiBros: It's like a computer virus that's meant to disrupt Neo's life signal so that they can pinpoint where Neo's body is in the power plant. Renxo: Which is your favourite flick? WachowskiBros: Too many to answer. unholyTrinity: When did you think about making this movie for the very first time? Was there a kind of special inspiration given by any event, occasion or something like that? WachowskiBros: It all happened very rapidly. We were working on another comic book, and a friend asked us if we had any ideas for a new series We said no, and then we just started talking about a couple of ideas that we had been working on in connection to cyberpunk fiction. A whole idea sort of exploded, over a period of about three days. On DVD, the pod sequence. WachowskiBros: We're pretty happy with the way this scene turned out. Keanu did some amazing work in this scene which included 6 hours every morning of prosthetic makeup. And he had to sit in a freezing cold vat of goo for another six hours. Renxo: Where were you born? WachowskiBros:Chicago. WachowskiBros: I was very happy with the Don Davis score in this scene, that included his use of a boy soprano, which I thought was very eerie. Don had a great idea, to use a human voice choir in scenes like the power plant and scenes on the Neb to sort of suggest the plight of humanity. Doc: So, WAS the Japanese animation Megazone 23 an inspiration for the Matrix? The stories seem very similar. WachowskiBros: I've never seen it. But send us a copy, it sounds good. theman: How did you guys come up with the idea for the Matrix? Playing video games? Shock therapy? WachowskiBros: No, designer drugs. Starr22: Is all the religious symbolism and doctrine throughout this movie intentional, or not? WachowskiBros: Most of it is intentional. On DVD, on the Neb, Neo is being plugged in for the first time. WachowskiBros: One of the things we tried to do with the Neb, when we were shooting \"in the real world\", was use long lenses to separate the humans from the background; as opposed to when we shot the Matrix, we used short lenses to place the humans in specific deep spaces. We also tinted all of the lights blue in the \"real world\" and green in the Matrix. Renxo: Do you reflect your personality on NEO's character? Were you/are you... hackers? WachowskiBros: We're probably not good enough to call ourselves hackers, like NEO. On DVD, Morpheus shows Neo the desert of the real. WachowskiBros: There have been many questions about the history that Morpheus suggests in this scene, we have written the history in a fair amount of detail. We've often hoped that if we did an anime series, we would tell the story of this history and the story of the first One Somebody asked us about the liquification of humans, that's what they feed the people in the pods, the dead people are liquified and fed to the living people in the pods. Always recycle! It's a statement on recycling. White_Beezatch: Will there ever be a Matrix video game? WachowskiBros: Hopefully yes. If things work out the way we want them to, the video game will be released when the next movie comes out and it will actually have something to do with the movie. DrBasher: Who came up with the wardrobe, because Trinity's outfits rocked? So did Morpheus' and Neo's. Was it part of the original script? WachowskiBros: We described her as a woman in black leather in the script. But, mainly the costumes were designed by Kym Barrett. Chandler: Since you have worked with the same composer and cinematographer (the great Bill Pope) did you find that it was easier to think ahead about a visual or musical style for the film? WachowskiBros: Did Bill Pope ask this question? No, but it's easier to execute them. You develop a shorthand language with people you've worked with before You tell Bill, we need a B move, and he knows what to do. pomru: My friends and I are wondering what anime you showed the producers to get this movie greenlit? WachowskiBros: If only it had been that easy. We had to draw the entire movie, and Keanu Reeves had to agree to do the movie, before anybody green-lit it. DrBasher: Also, the special effects rocked, was the script conceived knowing the special effects were available, or were the special effects conceived to make the script possible? WachowskiBros: Some of the special effects had to be invented, mainly Bullet Time. yellerdog:What are the odds of the Wachowskis directing a \"straight up\" live action adaptation of an anime? WachowskiBros: I thought we did. DrBasher: How long did it take to come up with the script, because it's great? WachowskiBros: We wrote the script before we had even directed Bound, and worked on it up until the time of production. TGee: When did you first think you would have such a huge hit on your hands? WachowskiBros: It kind of was like a giant art house hit, in that it just kept going and going and people kept talking about it and there was never a moment where people were like \"it's huge\". People liked it, and it just kept going. On DVD, the Dojo sequence. WachowskiBros: This scene took fifteen days to shoot, and about four months of training...it's all Keanu. This is Keanu running up the pillar and doing the full airborne 360. ToiletCommando: Are you going to do any projects besides the Matrix? WachowskiBros: Maybe. If we're still alive. ToiletCommando: Is it hard to work as brothers? Don't you disagree on everything? WachowskiBros: Mom flies down to the set everyday to settle every one of our arguments. BigMac: Rumor has it that Cypher is not dead....is this true? WachowskiBros: If you ask Joey Pants, it is. Joey Pants started that rumor. garrett: Isn't it rather ironic that Morpheus and his crew are completely dependent upon technology and computers, the very evils against which they are fighting? WachowskiBros: Yes! On DVD, the Jump Program. WachowskiBros: That shot, where Morpheus jumps up out of frame, we called \"The Worst Camera Operator Shot in the World\". ooo: What is the Matrix? WachowskiBros: About 2 hours and fifteen minutes long. spark: What made you decide on the green tint for being in the Matrix? WachowskiBros: It was a whole motif inspired by the phosphorous green of old PCs. On DVD, the woman in the red dress. WachowskiBros: People don't realize how important this scene is, because we are all staring at the woman in the red dress! There are actually twins and triplets that we hired in that scene. And all of the clothes are based on black and white costumes, like nuns, chefs, brides, sailors We had the idea that Mouse just doubled people instead of making originals. But we couldn't afford to do it digitally, so we ended up hiring as many doubles, or as many twins, as we could find in Sydney. It was kind of like a bad dream on the set. grey: How did you get the money for \"The Matrix\"? WachowskiBros: Begged. And the big-hearted Warner Brothers came through. Stone: Would you like to direct Jackie Chan? WachowskiBros: Sure! Lyn: Have you guys been approached to direct Batman? WachowskiBros: Yes, but we thought we'd be busy doing the sequels. On DVD, The Sentinels attack. WachowskiBros: We're pretty happy with the way the sentinels turned out. The digital artist that John Gaeta found did some amazing work. Cypher, at the beginning of this scene, is setting up an automated system to allow him to go meet with Agent Smith. EZGuest316: Could you say a little about the sound design, which was terrific, such as the slo-mo bullet ripple effects, foley effects? WachowskiBros: Dane Davis is a genius. He built all of these sound effects from all kinds of original sounds. He'd put bullets on strings and whirl them around his studio. He digitized raindrops against window panes to create the sound of the Matrix code. On DVD, Cypher enjoys steak. WachowskiBros: By the way, this steak was one of the best steaks we had in Sydney. We got to eat all of the ones that Cypher didn't finish. JediKnight: Have you been approached with any sci-fi scripts and do you have plans to do any? WachowskiBros: Right now, we're focusing just on Matrix 2 and 3. Freethinker: Just out of curiosity, do you guys hold to any religious beliefs? WachowskiBros: Non-denominational. On DVD, a breakfast of champions. WachowskiBros: Several of the cast members actually got sick eating this stuff during this scene. Astral_Traveler: How did you choose the music? WachowskiBros: For the most part, we chose the music ourselves. But we hired a consultant DJ in LA named Jason Bentley, a musical whiz kid, who had a lot of swell ideas. JimmyEO971: Will Joe Pantoliano be the DeNiro to your Scorsese, the Divine to your John Waters? WachowskiBros: There is a court order against Joe Pantoliano for coming within a hundred feet of us. biggysmalls: How many bluescreen/greenscreen shots are in this movie? WachowskiBros: That's a good question. There's 450 digital effect shots, but green screen? Probably about 125. wrygrass: Did ideas from Buddhism influence you in making the film? WachowskiBros: Yes. There's something uniquely interesting about Buddhism and mathematics, particularly about quantum physics, and where they meet That has fascinated us for a long time. gdreams: Will you use Yuen Woo Ping again? WachowskiBros: Hell yes! gtbpitt: Do you think The Matrix will develop a cult following in the decades to come? WachowskiBros: We hope it's as big as the Night of the Lepus. On DVD, The Oracle's apartment. WachowskiBros: This is my wife [Larry] about to be on the screen here. She comes in right there!.... This kid is great! letmein: The phrase \"paying taxes\" comes up a few times. Why? WachowskiBros: Because we usually couldn't afford to pay ours. It is an examination of what is,k and is not, certain. Tank: I am a computer artist and I am very interested in knowing what type of computers and software you used to create the 3D effects? WachowskiBros: A lot of the guys at Manex wrote their programs with Softimage. We think. On DVD, The Oracle. WachowskiBros: Awesome actress! Wesbran: Is the title \"The Matrix\" related to the mitochondrial matrix located in cells; the site of cell respiration, the creation of energy in humans? WachowskiBros: Like the movie itself, there is alot of word play, a lot of hidden other meanings, alot of multiple meanings. Besides that, we also like the definition, the mathematical definition of the use of matrix, or the use of it in terms of a woman's womb. DVDReporter383: Do you surf fan sites? Do you have the time? WachowskiBros: We've looked at a few. There's some cool ones out there. virtualMatrix: What is the significance of Neo eating the Oracle's cookie? WachowskiBros: There was a piece cut out of the movie that explained the significance more. It's hard to explain. agunn3: Have you ever been told that the Matrix has Gnostic overtones? WachowskiBros: Do you consider that to be a good thing? I would. RockyMtnBri: Any chance of novels being written above and beyond the movie, like Star Wars? WachowskiBros: Maybe. Freethinker: The Matrix was very well received by critics, as well. Did that surprise you? How much stock do you hold in critics? WachowskiBros: There were some critics that really didn't like it. Did it surprise us that some liked it? You don't really hold much stock in critics, you tend to make movies for first, yourselves, and second, your audience. And the greatest thing about critics is that sometimes they can help find your audience. AgentMarr: What was the thinking behind the use of numbers that can be read both ways like 303 on the hotel door where Neo meets his destiny? WachowskiBros: Like the word play, there's a lot of number play in the movie as well. Mike: What were your fondest moments while filming The Matrix? WachowskiBros: Finishing! On DVD, the escape from the Lafayette Hotel. WachowskiBros: This scene, this set right here, the wet wall, is something like forty-eight feet high, and they are actually really worming their way down with wires. DVDReporter383: Do you surf the net? If so, where do you go? WachowskiBros: We're everywhere. linusa: Do you believe that our world is in some way similar to \"The Matrix\", that there is a larger world outside of this existence? WachowskiBros: That is a larger question than you actually might think We think the most important sort of fiction attempts to answer some of the big questions. One of the things that we had talked about when we first had the idea of The Matrix was an idea that I believe philosophy and religion and mathematics all try to answer. Which is, a reconciling between a natural world and another world that is perceived by our intellect. godbox: Confronted with Neo's choice, which would you choose? WachowskiBros: Blue pill. Lincoln: What comment do you have to those who say that the Matrix will probably be recognised as the first 21st film? WachowskiBros: Well, first we'd be grateful for the comment. Then we'd have to point out the clerical error that it's in the 20th Century, and not the 21st until 2001. wrygrass: Did you do camcorder films or other film practice that helped you direct? WachowskiBros: No, nothing on video, but we did fiddle around with 16 mm film. Revenge: What is the symbolism of all the analog rotary phones? WachowskiBros: There's a couple of meanings. We liked the analog nature of older technology. We liked the suggestion of old original phone hackers, it sort of suggested the big Rube Goldberg device that's in the mirror scene. Inge: What was it like seeing the movie with a audience for the first time? WachowskiBros: Terrifying. On DVD, Agent Smith tries to get Morpheus to give the access codes to Zion. WachowskiBros: That's the largest translight ever constructed, and that is actual mercury in the hypodermic needle, by the way It was considered one of our most dangerous sets, because we had mercury, it had to be poured into the hypodermic needle. Stone: Was the Alice in Wonderland theme just whim, or do you guys have a big love of it? WachowskiBros: Big fan! It is a brilliant book. Many of the themes we tried to echo in The Matrix. Orange_Crush: I noticed that The Matrix is currently #30 in the IMDB top 250. That's quite an achievement. How do you feel about being classified with other legendary films and filmmakers? WachowskiBros: Lucky. Wesbran: What happens to all the gadgets in this movie after it is done filming? WachowskiBros: Most of them are so fragile they break as soon as you're done filming. And Joel Silver collects the rest. Sinclair: Why were they only able to jack in through hard-lines, but still able to communicate over cell? WachowskiBros: Sinclair, good question! Mostly we felt that the amount of information that was being sent into the Matrix required a significant portal. Those portals, we felt, were better described with the hard lines rather than cell lines We also felt that the rebels tried to be invisible when they hacked, that's why all the entrances and exits were sort of through decrepit and low traffic areas of the Matrix. The12thMonkey: The guy that played the lead agent was worryingly convincing, did it take a long time to find him? WachowskiBros: Yes, actually, and that was one of the fortuitous things about going to Sydney, it led us to find Hugo. wrygrass: You said in an interview that string theory might show up in the film, did it? WachowskiBros: Maybe in the next one, I have just now begun to understand string theory. whatismyname: What's your favourite music? WachowskiBros: We love all music. ZEUS: How did you finaly choose the names of the characters? WachowskiBros: They were all chosen carefully, and all of them have multiple meanings. Qualopec: How hard was it to get the kind of budget you wanted for this film? WachowskiBros: We had to go across the world to secure that budget. wrygrass: Do you have any funny stories from filming you'd share? WachowskiBros: That newspaper had to be actually a giant piece of metal with newspaper glued to metal pages. How's that for funny? Lincoln: What is your fave line in the movie? WachowskiBros: Dodge this. And \"there is no spoon.\" We also liked that one. Mahy: Do all of the things that happen in the Matrix have some computer-based analogy...or did you just do some of it because it was cool? WachowskiBros: Yes. We like to try and pack as much stuff as we can in when we do a movie. So some of the stuff we do relates to the narrative, and some of the stuff we do because we like. biggysmalls: Do you like the Planet of the Apes? WachowskiBros: Yes, love it! \" Get your damned dirty hands off, you stinkin' ape!\". Enigma: The character Neo: Is Neo his real self and Thomas Anderson who he is 'required' to be? WachowskiBros: Neo is Thomas Anderson's potential self. Job: Do you realize that your new ideas have changed the way people will see movies in the future? WachowskiBros: Really? On DVD, Morpheus escapes from the Agents. WachowskiBros: The idea of Bullet Time came about because we wanted to shoot an event at incredibly high speed which means slow motion, but move the camera at regular speed, which is impossible. The first theory for Bullet Time involved a rocket camera that was abandoned for safety purposes Then, John Gaeta suggested a digital solution. Which brought it to the screen keanucarrie: Which scene was the hardest to shoot? WachowskiBros: The subway fight scene. It was incredibly cold, everyone was very sick, and it went ten days over schedule. It was particularly brutal to the two actors. Dogma: Have there been any discussions with comic book companies to publish a monthly-type of comic based on the Matrix, not just an adaptation, perhaps with Darrow illustrating it? WachowskiBros: We're going to release another series of stories on the website, Geof Darrow is going to illustrate a couple more short stories written by Andy and I. And, we've toyed with the idea of continuing the story in comic book form when the movies are finished. Trinity303: Do you like John Woo's movies and style of shooting scenes of action? WachowskiBros: John Woo was a genius. John Woo IS a genius. tonka: What do you think about Star Wars? WachowskiBros: It was one of the first films that we went berserk over when we were kids. kr: How long had you been working on writing the story, and was there re-writing going on while filming? WachowskiBros: There was not much re-writing, a little bit. Somebody asked us about the street names in the movie and all of them are significant. They are all based on places in Chicago. Santayana: I love the casting of this film Specifically, Hugo Weaving. Why him? WachowskiBros: We had seen the movie \"Proof\",so we flew Hugo into LA to meet, and he did a phenomenal reading...and was willing to undergo the four months of training. He's one of the finest actors we've ever worked with Hiryu: Did you ever consider doing a cameo appearance in the movie? WachowskiBros: We're too ugly! On DVD, the subway where Neo faces off with Agent Smith. WachowskiBros: This shot here, the showdown shot, is an homage to Sergio Leone. joe: I am amazed by the physical performance, the actors had great training. What do you think? WachowskiBros: We're amazed as well. We think all four of them went beyond our expectations. Revenge: Any influence from Blade Runner? WachowskiBros: Blade Runner was a benchmark science fiction film, a masterpiece. Of course there's influence. But we were like the only guys who liked that movie when we saw it, everyone else hated it. Freethinker: Did you know right away that it would be a trilogy? WachowskiBros: We knew we had too much material for one movie. inkman: Do you two feel that sci-fi is overlooked in the \"Awards\" arena? WachowskiBros: We don't put much credence in the \"awards\" arena. On DVD, Neo and Agent Smith in full fight. WachowskiBros: There are some fantastic stunts in this sequence like THAT one! Both the Australian stunt team and the Hong Kong stunt team worked very well together in this scene. AgentMartin: Do you appreciate people dissecting your movie? Do you find it a bit of an honour, or does it annoy you a little, especially when the person may have it all wrong? WachowskiBros: There's not necessarily ever an \"all wrong\". Because it's about what a person gets out of the movie, what an individual gets out of the movie. Vindicator: The whole idea of electronic stimuli of atrophied muscles is great. Did you guys consult any medical experts for accuracy? WachowskiBros: As a matter of fact, one of our best friends is a doctor. He was the guy to show us our first autopsy. On DVD, the Agents chasing Neo through a fruit market. WachowskiBros: Watermelons, that was an homage to Gallagher. On the TV, when Neo goes by there's an episode of \"The Prisoner\". Action: Am I really watching the movie right now, or am I in...The Matrix? WachowskiBros: Take another blue pill and call me tomorrow. rawdogg: Why did you never show Zion? WachowskiBros: We're saving it for Matrix 2. Nebelis: What other projects did the camera man work on and where did you find him? WachowskiBros: If you mean Bill Pope, he did our first movie \"Bound\" and the masterpiece \"Army of Darkness\". Pill: Do you plan to write any books about this? WachowskiBros: There is a 'Making Of' book that's coming out later this year. virtualMatrix: Do you believe one day, intelligent machines with AI will actually rule the world? WachowskiBros: Yes. If they don't already! AcesAreWild: Who Invented BULLET TIME PHOTOGRAPHY? WachowskiBros: The original concept was ours, but the technical execution was by a company called Manex. AgentMartin: Many take the make of the Neb, \"Mark 3, V.11\" and quote it from the bible \"Mark 3:11\". Was this intended or is it just the make and model of the Neb and nothing more subliminal than that? WachowskiBros: The Nebuchanezzer is indeed a biblical reference, from the book of Daniel. linusa: Will you ever tell the history of the Matrix in a novel? WachowskiBros: Maybe. Renxo: Are you doing any personal presentations, anywhere? WachowskiBros: No. NIKKI: Who unplugged Morpheus and told him about the Matrix? WachowskiBros: We hope to tell that story in another medium one day. Neotek: How much of an influence was William Gibson in the production and design of this movie? WachowskiBros: We're big fans of William Gibson's work. Ronin: Your movie has many and varied connections to myth and philsophy, Judeo-Christian, Egyptian, Arthurian, and Platonic, just to name those I've noticed. How much of that was intentional? WachowskiBros: All of it. That wraps the chat. On leaving, Larry and Andy had one more comment. WachowskiBros: Sorry we could only get to 1 percent of your questions. We do appreciate all of your support. And we'll see you in three years."], "label": "AMBIG", "category": "Wice", "additional_info": {"original_label": "NS"}}

Variety Intelligence Platform July 7, 2009 1:22PM PT # Michael Jackson's mega farewell ## Fans, friends pay tribute to the King of Pop Presented by AEG. Reviewed July 7, 2009. Live from Staples Center; 20,000 seats; free distribution by lottery from a pool of 1.6 millionPerformers: Ron Boyd, Kobe Bryant, Mariah Carey, Andrae Crouch Choir, Berry Gordy, Jennifer Hudson, Shaheen Jafargholi, Magic Johnson, Martin Luther King III, Bernice A. King, John Mayer, Lionel Richie, Smokey Robinson, Rev. Al Sharpton, Brooke Shields, Pastor Lucious Smith, Usher and Stevie Wonder. There was Elvis, there was John Lennon, there was Princess Diana, and now there's Michael Jackson, the first celebrity to inspire global paroxysms of grief in the 21st century. Measured by his media coverage as well as his posthumous legal and medical issues, not to mention his mourning fans, it's possible that Jackson has topped them all. On Tuesday morning, downtown Los Angeles was transformed into a humming mini-economy dedicated to the memory of the entertainer. Amid something of a police state, with helicopters buzzing overhead and packs of officers stationed along Figueroa Avenue, the throngs of ticket holders, makeshift T-shirt vendors and wishful thinkers created an atmosphere that was almost friendly. Jackson spokesman Ken Sunshine had said he hoped the lottery-based ticket distribution for the Staples Center memorial service would be conducted with \"dignity\" — a wish that might seem far-fetched for an event conducted in a space that would next host the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. Certainly the numbers were impressive: 19,500 mourners at Staples and another 5,500 at the Nokia Theater simulcast. Meanwhile, Tuesday saw endless hours of TV and online coverage domestically and around the world. AEG, which organized the memorial, said figures will be available today for global carriers and estimates of viewers. CNN estimated that the memorial yielded the second-highest live vid streaming day in CNN.com's history, with the site serving up 9.7 million video streams. Hulu reported that Tuesday was its second-highest live vid streaming day after the Obama inauguration in January. Clearly, it takes a global village to mourn a superstar. While the memorial was a spectacle, it also offered no shortage of sorrow, genuine emotion and, yes, dignity. Though predictions about downtown gridlock were ominous, less than 1,000 people showed up around the lockdown perimeter, and things went generally well despite the tight time frame in which this event was assembled. However, the morning wasn't without its glitches. An LAPD officer outside L.A. Live's Club Nokia said, \"We're a little behind schedule for family considerations,\" a reference to the family's morning service at Forest Lawn in Glendale. Inside Staples, Smokey Robinson appeared as the first speaker at 10:10 a.m. After reading statements of sympathy from Diana Ross and Nelson Mandela, Robinson returned to his seat, and the arena fell quiet for 20 long minutes, silent enough to hear the purr of the A/C system. Finally, as the Andrae Crouch Choir filed on stage at 10:33 a.m., the Jackson family walked into the arena. Acting as pallbearers were Michael Jackson's brothers (each wearing aviator sunglasses and one sparkly glove), wheeling in an enormous gold-plated casket covered in red roses. Given the ornate presentation, it was a moment that could have tipped into the baroque. Instead, the casket served as a valid reminder of what had been lost. The first speaker was Pastor Lucious Smith, who, like those who followed him, came onstage without introduction. His words effectively framed what was to come, describing Jackson as a brother, son, father and friend who would be celebrated \"in the space where, only days ago, he danced and sang.\" Punctuating the service throughout was audible sniffling from the audience along with cries of \"I love you, Michael!\" and \"We all love you, Michael!\" Mariah Carey and Trey Lorenz provided the first performance with the Jackson 5 song \"I'll Be There.\" Queen Latifah introduced her remarks by saying that she was \"representing all the fans,\" a remark she underlined with a remembrance of buying the Jackson 5 album \"Dance Machine\" and trying to learn to dance the robot with her brother. She also read a poem by Maya Angelou dedicated to Jackson, \"We Had Him,\" which began: \"Now that we know/we know nothing… We had him/He took a pose/on his toes/for all of us.\" Lionel Richie sang the gospel-tinged Commodores song \"Jesus Is Love\" with a choral backing. While his performance was heartfelt, the projected backdrop of anonymous church arches seemed strange in an environment that was otherwise deeply personal. Former Motown head Berry Gordy said Jackson \"raised the bar and broke the bar.\" He also spoke of the \"competitiveness\" at Motown, perhaps alluding to the internal strife that led to the Jackson 5 leaving Motown in 1975. \"He had some sad times and some questionable decisions on his part, but he accomplished everything he dreamed of,\" Gordy said. \"He did have two personalities. He was another person onstage, a master showman who was 'kill or be killed.' 'The King of Pop' isn't big enough — he was the greatest entertainer who ever lived.\" This brought the audience to its feet for the first of a number of standing ovations. Stevie Wonder's voice was weighted with emotion before he launched into \"Never Dreamed You'd Leave in Summer.\" \"This is a moment that I wish I didn't live to see,\" Wonder said. Kobe Bryant hailed Jackson for his charity work, while Magic Johnson said that one of the greatest moments of his life was a dinner with Michael that offered a private chef but culminated in \"sitting on the floor and eating that bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken.\" He also said that Michael's children would benefit from \"a most incredible grandmother\" along with uncles, aunts and cousins — a list in which father Joe Jackson was notably omitted. Jennifer Hudson provided a rousing, choir-backed performance of \"Will You Be There,\" inspiring the audience to clap in time. In a moment that carried the power of a tent revival meeting, Rev. Al Sharpton hailed Michael for \"creating a comfort level\" that allowed the world to see African-Americans as worthy of attention and celebration. \"It wasn't strange to watch Oprah Winfrey on TV or to see Tiger Woods play golf … or to vote an African-American as president.\" He also nodded to the controversy that defined much of Michael's life. \"There are those who want to focus on his mess. It's not about his mess; it's his message.\" To Michael's children, he said: \"Wasn't nothing strange about your daddy. It was strange what your daddy had to deal with.\" John Mayer's performance of \"Human Nature\" on guitar suggested an easy-listening take, with an outspoken melody line and whispered vocals by backing singers. Brooke Shields' halting, emotional speech described Jackson as offering \"the most natural and easy of friendships … We both knew what it was like to be in a spotlight from a young age. I would tease him, 'You were a slacker. I was 11 months old when I started. You were, what, 5?' \" Michael's brother Jermaine then sang what Shields said was Michael's favorite song, \"Smile,\" written by Charlie Chaplin for \"Modern Times.\" Martin Luther King III and his sister, Bernice A. King, described Michael as \"the best of what he was,\" while U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) announced Resolution 600, which she drafted and brought to Congress' attention the day after Michael's death. (HR 600 calls for the House of Representatives to recognize the performer \"as a global humanitarian and a noted leader in the fight against worldwide hunger and medical crises; and celebrates Michael Jackson as an accomplished contributor to the worlds of arts and entertainment, scientific advances in the treatment of HIV/AIDS and global food security.\" It's since been referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs.) Usher descended from the stage to address much of his performance of \"Gone Too Soon\" to Michael's casket. The service ended with a group performance of \"We Are the World,\" followed by individual remembrances from Jermaine, Marlon and, most notably, Paris, Michael's much-protected daughter. It was heartrending, if a little disturbing, to see grief displayed so clearly in a young girl whose life before now was entirely private. The service was presented by AEG, produced by Kenny Ortega and Ken Ehrlich and directed by Ortega.

McGill wildlife biology professor Dr. David Bird said his greatest fear is that people will leap to pick obvious species like the Canada goose or the loon and, in the end, the Canadian Geographic Society will be obligated to persuade politicians of the merits of an unsuitable bird as our national symbol. FELIX ORDONEZ/REUTERS Gloria Galloway Parliamentary Reporter OTTAWA Published January 22, 2015 Updated May 12, 2018 Comments What bird possesses the personality that speaks to the spirit of Canada in the same way the bald eagle exemplifies the resilience of our neighbours to the south? This country, home to more than 450 species of birds, is among just a handful of nations that have not selected one as a national symbol. Yes, we have the beaver and the maple leaf. But we do not have a bird. Story continues below advertisement So the Royal Canadian Geographical Society is asking Canadians to weigh in online and choose the species of winged creature that is worthy of the national designation. The society will then lobby the federal government to follow through with an Act of Parliament as part of the sesquicentennial celebrations in 2017. The project was launched in the January issue of the Canadian Geographic magazine, and Nick Walker, the managing editor, says the response has been \"overwhelming.\" \"People like to identify traits like intelligence, sociability, friendliness, curiosity, aggression and nobility,\" Mr. Walker said, \"and all of those things that, I think, can be accurate when looking at any number of birds.\" The magazine asked several well-known authors to expound upon their own personal choice for national bird. Noah Richler picked the raven. He called it \"resourceful, a survivor, as the territory compels most Canadians to be.\" Charlotte Gray favoured the ospreys that nest in the white pine near her family's cottage south of Ottawa. Will Ferguson rallied behind the Canada goose, a \"bad-tempered\" bird that has the kind of attitude he wants in a national emblem. Story continues below advertisement With more than 4,000 votes logged on the Canadian Geographic website, the leader is the common loon – a result that is not unexpected given its prominence on our currency. To which David Bird, an emeritus professor of wildlife biology at McGill University and an ornithologist who, for 28 years, wrote a column about birds for the Montreal Gazette, says horse feathers. The obvious choice for national bird, Dr. Bird said, is the gray jay. It is not resplendent like a peacock (the national bird of India), or imposing like the Andean condor (the national bird of Bolivia), or colourful like the crimson sunbird (the national bird of Singapore.) It is grey. Isn't that rather fitting? asks Dr. Bird. \"Aren't Canadians accused of being a bland boring people?\" But the gray jay, sometimes called the whiskey jack, is also one of the smartest birds on the planet, he said. And it is friendly. Skiers who come across them on trails through the country's woodlands find them gently petitioning for food. Story continues below advertisement The gray jay's French name is le Mésangeai du Canada. It lives in every province and territory of Canada, but hardly at all in the United States, Dr. Bird said. It is not an endangered species, so Canada would not risk finding itself birdless in the near future. It is not a target of hunters, so it is not going to end up on Canadian dinner plates. \"It is also a very hardy bird. It is adapted for living in very cold regions, like we Canadians,\" he said. And it does not migrate. \"Not all Canadians do the snowbird thing. A lot of us love the snow and love enjoying our winters.\" The gray jay is a resident of Canada's boreal forests, which are under environmental pressure, Dr. Bird said. \"Having this as our official bird, I think it will help get Canadians to make the effort to go to the boreal forest, appreciate it, and want to save it,\" he said. But what about the loon? That's already Ontario's provincial bird, Dr. Bird said. \"Ontario will be smug about it and say, 'Our provincial bird is now the national bird.' But they are not going to give it up.\" Story continues below advertisement And the snowy owl? It belongs to Quebec. Canada geese? They are culled in the United States because they are such a nuisance, Dr. Bird said. \"They are basically pooping machines.\" Charlotte Gray's osprey? \"The osprey is regularly robbed by the bald eagle of their fish,\" Dr. Bird said. \"Do we want a bird that is being robbed by the United States all the time?\" Many people have been surprised to learn that Canada does not have a national bird, Mr. Walker said. But the passion Canadians feel for their favourite bird comes through loud and clear in the comments attached to the online votes, he said. Like the one from Connor Albanese, a seven-year-old who lives in Rockwood, Ont. He argues for the great blue heron. \"It is the best bird,\" he writes. \"It has fiery eyes for hunting frogs, fish, snakes, mice and bugs.\" Dr. Bird said his greatest fear is that people will leap to pick obvious species like the Canada goose or the loon and, in the end, the Canadian Geographic Society will be obligated to persuade politicians of the merits of an unsuitable bird as our national symbol. Story continues below advertisement \"Just because people vote democratically,\" he said, \"doesn't mean they always make the right choice.\" ## Related From motmots to tomtits: discover the world's best birdwatching Backyard hockey rinks remain a rich winter tradition in Canada From teddy bears to couches: Why brands use symbols to win your heart Follow Gloria Galloway on Twitter @glorgal Report an error Editorial code of conduct Comments"], "label": "AMBIG", "category": "Wice", "additional_info": {"original_label": "NS"}}

Sheppard Monday, Sept. 24, 1979 Follow @TIME THE RIGHT STUFF by Tom Wolfe; Farrar, Straus & Giroux; 436 pages; $12.95 May 5, 1961: the day Alan Shepard scratched his back on the edge of space and America entered the manned space race. At last. Since 1957 there had been all those Sputniks—Mechtas and Vostoks—beeping overhead, clockwork reminders that the heavens were in the hands of the godless Bolshevik. The script had gone awry. A nation only 40 years from feudalism was secretly lobbing what looked like customized samovars at the free world while priapic Vanguards and Jupiters wilted on their pads or exploded prematurely for all the world to see. Democracy could be embarrassing. The oaken voice of Walter Cronkite echoes in the memory of America's entry into the competition There were resonant suspense at lift-offs and tremolos of pride at splashdowns: America still had the right stuff, Wolfe's buzz word for the indefinable attributes of the astronauts. His long awaited book about test pilots and the Mercury flights recalls those years through the eyes and nerve endings of the first astronauts, their wives and even the conditioned chimpanzees who rode prototype capsules downrange from Cape Canaveral: The chimp's &\"heart rate shot up as he strained against the force, but he didn't panic for a moment. He had been through this same sensation many times on the centrifuge As long as he just took it and didn't struggle, they wouldn't zap all those goddamned blue bolts into the soles of his feet. There were a lot worse things in this world than g-forces ... The main thing was to keep ahead of those blue bolts in the feet!... He started pushing the buttons and throwing the switches like the greatest electric Wurlitzer organist who ever lived...\" The jazzy mix of facts and fictional technique, Céline's ellipses, the gadzooks delivery and a presumptuous ape's-eye view that would have curled Henry James' worsteds—these are unmistakable parts of Wolfe's style It is still called the New Journalism, although the form is as old as the Beatles and the author is now 48. Like the Beatles, Wolfe has had a revolutionary impact on his field. His imitators have spread like dandelion fluff, and his work still stirs furious debate. Yet even the creakiest practitioner of the inverted-pyramid style of journalism will have to agree that behind the mannered realism of The Right Stuff thumps the heart of a traditionalist. The organizing principle of the book is an old-fashioned fascination with, and admiration for, the test pilots and fighter jocks of the U.S.'s first astronaut team: Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper, John Glenn, Gus Grissom, Wally Schirra, Alan Shepard and Deke Slayton. In addition, the book has a superhero, Chuck Yeager, a World War II combat veteran who broke the sound barrier in 1947 and rewrote aviation history in experimental rocket-powered planes of the '50s and early '60s.

A total of 6982 patients were enrolled during the control period and 7804 patients were enrolled following prestorage leukoreduction.   \n MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES All-cause in-hospital mortality and serious nosocomial infections (pneumonia, bacteremia, septic shock, all surgical site infections) occurring after first transfusion and at least 2 days after index procedure or intensive care unit admission. Secondary outcomes included rates of posttransfusion fever and antibiotic use.   \n RESULTS Unadjusted in-hospital mortality rates were significantly lower following the introduction of leukoreduction compared with the control period (6.19% vs 7.03%, respectively; P =.04). Compared with the control period, the adjusted odds of death following leukoreduction were reduced (odds ratio [OR], 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75-0.99), but serious nosocomial infections did not decrease (adjusted OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.87-1.09). The frequency of posttransfusion fevers decreased significantly following leukoreduction (adjusted OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79-0.94), as did antibiotic use (adjusted OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82-0.99).   \n CONCLUSION A national universal leukoreduction program is potentially associated with decreased mortality as well as decreased fever episodes and antibiotic use after red blood cell transfusion in high-risk patients."], "label": "AMBIG", "category": "scifact", "additional_info": {"original_label": "S"}}
